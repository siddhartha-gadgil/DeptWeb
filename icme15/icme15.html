		The National Board for Higher Mathematics (NBHM), has the possibility of sponsoring a limited number of Indian mathematics educators to participate in ICME-15. NBHM will
sponsor a small delegation which will have a reasonable percentage of women mathematics
educators and will be a balanced mix of senior (age 40 and above), junior (age below 40)
mathematics educators who are regular members of a recognized research institution or
university and a small number of post-doctoral fellows and PhD students who are at an
advanced stage of their doctoral programme.
The NBHM support is expected to contribute towards expenses related to travel,
accommodation and living expenses (at rates in line with the norms of the Government of
India) and the (advance) registration fee.
The grant will only be given to those who agree to attend the entire conference.
Those interested in participating in ICME-15 and are without other means of full support may
fill the application.
