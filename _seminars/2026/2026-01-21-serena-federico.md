In this talk, we will discuss the validity of smoothing estimates for variable coefficient third order equations, including, among others, KdV and ZK equations
with variable coefficients. As a consequence of the aforementioned result, we will show that the nonlinear problem associated with the class of operators under
consideration is locally well-posed.
