 It is known that a manifold diffeomorphic to a K3 surface admits an almost toric fibration (ATF). However, given a specific symplectic 
form on a K3 it is unclear if it admits an almost toric fibration with lagrangian fibres for the given form. In this talk, we shall 
see that when a Kahler K3 surface admits a Type III Kulikov degeneration with a symplectic form taming the complex structure, the 
symplectic form admits an ATF whose base is the intersection complex of the degenerate fibre. Furthermore, we shall show that a 
smooth anti-canonical hypersurface in a smooth toric Fano threefold, equipped with a toric Kähler form, admits such a symplectic 
Kulikov model.  This is based on joint work with Yoel Groman.
