Consider a noncompact homogeneous space equipped with the action of a one-parameter diagonable subgroup. In this dynamical system we study the set of points with precompact
orbit which, due to the work of Kleinbock--Margulis, is known to be a dense set of full dimension. Motivated by a theorem of Davenport-Schmidt in Diophantine approximation
we revisit this work and give a construction for bounded orbits with large closures.
