The talk concerns a larger class of popular (piecewise) quadratic schemes for the fourth-order plate bending problems based on triangles are the nonconforming Morley finite
element, two discontinuous Galerkin, the $C^0$ interior penalty, and the WOPSIP schemes. The first part of the presentation discusses recent applications to the linear
bi-Laplacian and to semi-linear fourth-order problems like the stream function vorticity formulation of incompressible 2D Navier--Stokes problem and the von Kármán plate
bending problem. The role of a smoother is emphasised and reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimators give rise to adaptive mesh-refining strategies that recover
optimal rates in numerical experiments. The last part addresses recent developments on adaptive multilevel Argyris finite element methods. The presentation is based on joint
work with B. Gräßle (University of Zurich) and N. Nataraj (IITB in Mumbai).
