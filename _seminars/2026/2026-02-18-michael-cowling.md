Brascamp--Lieb inequalities generalise classical results such as H&ouml;lder's
inequality, Young's convolution inequality, and the Loomis--Whitney inequality.
In the context of euclidean spaces these inequalities have been intensively studied,
for their own intrinsic interest and for their applications in areas such as partial
differential equations and incidence geometry as well as for their connections to
problems in theoretical computer science. Brascamp–Lieb inequalities involving
finitely generated abelian groups have also been examined, as have those involving
finite-dimensional compact abelian groups. Recently Jon Bennett and the speaker
considered Brascamp–Lieb inequalities on general locally compact abelian groups.

It therefore seems timely to consider Brascamp--Lieb inequalities on nonabelian
groups. It might seem that the lack of commutativity would make things more
difficult. However, it also means that there are many fewer potential inequalities
to consider, and in some situations, all possible inequalities are built up out of
H¨older’s inequality and Young’s convolution inequality. We illustrate this by means
of examples, using compact Lie groups and Heisenberg-like groups.
