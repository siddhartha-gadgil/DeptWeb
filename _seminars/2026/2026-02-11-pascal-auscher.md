The kinetic Kolmogorov--Fokker--Planck (KFP) equations are the linearized versions for Boltzmann model (non-local integro-differential) or Landau model (local
differential). These were introduced by Kolmogorov and were exhibited by H&ouml;rmander as the main example for his theory of hypoelliptic equations based on
commutator information.  But the structure of kinetic spaces is still not well-understood. To draw a parallel, the kinetic spaces are for the KFP equations what
the Sobolev spaces are for elliptic equations. They form a scale of spaces in which functions (distributions) $f$ of time $t$, position $x$ and velocity $x$ have
regularity along the transport field $\partial_t + v \cdot \nabla_x$ and the velocity field $\nabla_v$, according to the scaling of the equation. We prove that
these two informations imply precise regularity in time and position. Our estimates are sharp and scale invariant, improving on earlier works of H&ouml;rmander
and Bouchut for the regularity with respect to position and in the spirit of the Lions embedding theorem for parabolic equations. They cover the optimal expected
range of exponents. The methods rely on Fourier transform estimates. This allows us to give structural information about kinetic spaces (density, completeness and
isomorphisms, embeddings...), to precisely describe the distributional solutions to the FKP equations with constant diffusion, to obtain well-posedness for weak
solutions when the FKP equations come with rough diffusion and to define their fundamental solutions, and more. This is based on joint works with C. Imbert and L. Niebel.
