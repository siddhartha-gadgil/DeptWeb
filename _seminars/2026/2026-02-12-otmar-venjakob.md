Inspired by Nakamura's work  on `$\epsilon$`-isomorphisms for `$(\varphi,\Gamma)$`-modules over (relative) Robba rings with respect to the cyclotomic theory we formulate an analogous conjecture for `$L$`-analytic Lubin-Tate `$(\varphi_L,\Gamma_L)$`-modules over (relative) Robba rings for any finite extension `$L$` of `$\mathbb{Q}_p$`. In contrast to Kato's and Nakamura's setting, our conjecture involves `$L$`-analytic cohomology instead of continuous cohomology within the generalized Herr complex. Similarly, we restrict to the identity components of `$D_{\text{cris}}$` and `$D_{dR}$`, respectively. For rank one modules of the above type or slightly more general for trianguline ones, we construct `$\epsilon$`-isomorphisms for their Lubin-Tate deformations satisfying the desired interpolation property. This is joint work with Milan Malcic, Rustam Steingart and Max Witzelsperger.
