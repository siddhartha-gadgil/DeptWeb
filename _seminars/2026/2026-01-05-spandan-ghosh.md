Lagrangian mean curvature flow (LMCF) is a way to deform a Lagrangian submanifold inside a Calabi--Yau manifold according to the 
negative gradient of the area functional. There are influential conjectures about LMCF due to Thomas--Yau and Joyce, describing the 
long-time behaviour of the flow, singularity formation, and how one may flow past singularities. In this talk, we will show how one may
flow out of a conically singular Lagrangian by gluing in expanders asymptotic to the cone, generalizing an earlier result by 
Begley--Moore. We solve the problem by a direct P.D.E.-based approach, along the lines of recent work by Lira--Mazzeo--Pluda--Saez 
on the network flow. The main technical ingredient we use is the notion of manifolds with corners and a-corners as introduced by 
Joyce following earlier work of Melrose.
