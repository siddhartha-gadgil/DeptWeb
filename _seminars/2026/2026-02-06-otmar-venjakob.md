The quadratic Reciprocity Law for the Legendre or Jacobi-Symbol forms the starting point of all Reciprocity Laws as well as of class field theory. It is closely
related to the product formula of the quadratic Hilbert-Symbol over local fields. Various mathematicians have established higher explicit formulae to compute
higher Hilbert-Symbols. Analogs were found for formal (Lubin--Tate) groups. Eventually Perrin-Riou has formulated a Reciprocity Law, which allows the explicit 
computation of local cup product pairings by means of Iwasawa- and $p$-adic Hodge Theory. In this talk I shall try to give an overview of these topics. At the end
I will explain recent developments in this regard.
