In order to study the complexity of function spaces, we estimate the asymptotics of the sequence of Kolmogorov $m$-widths of compact sets of holomorphic functions in
Bergman spaces, Hardy spaces and Fock spaces.

The techniques use some concentration results for the eigenvalues of a certain family of Toeplitz operators and an exhaustion procedure by special holomorphic
polyhedra, originating from Bishop's work.
