Tapping into the complexity of the local geometry of the Hilbert cuspidal eigenvariety at Eisenstein points, we will present a modular construction of an everywhere unramified `$\mathbb{Z}_p$`-extension in a setting which seems beyond the scope of the Iwasawa main conjecture. Part of the talk is based on a joint work with Adel Betina and Sheng-Chi Shih.
