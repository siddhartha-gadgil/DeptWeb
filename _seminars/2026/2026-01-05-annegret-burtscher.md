The Hopf-Rinow theorem is a fundamental result in Riemannian geometry relating metric completeness, properness, and geodesic 
completeness. We recall the many reasons why it does not hold in Lorentzian geometry. Then we present our joint work with 
García-Heveling relating global hyperbolicity and completeness of the null distance and show that and how this result can be 
viewed as an extension of the metric part of the Hopf-Rinow theorem to Lorentzian geometry. We end with some thoughts about the 
semi-Riemannian setting.
