The Helgason conjecture is a fundamental result in harmonic analysis on Riemannian symmetric manifolds of noncompact type. Let $G$ be a real semisimple
algebraic group and $K$ a maximal compact subgroup. The conjecture states that joint eigenfunctions of $G$-invariant differential operators on the
Riemannian symmetric space $G/K$ can be reconstructed through their boundary values by means of the Poisson transform. In this talk I will discuss a new proof.
This is joint work with Heiko Gimperlein, Bernhard Krötz and Henrik Schlichtkrull.
