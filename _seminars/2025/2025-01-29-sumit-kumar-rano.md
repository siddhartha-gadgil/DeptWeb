A theorem of Strichartz states that if a uniformly bounded bi-infinite sequence of functions on Euclidean spaces satisfies the property that the Laplacian
acting on one function in the sequence yields the next, then every function in this sequence is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian. This result was later
extended by replacing the standard Euclidean Laplacian with operators such as the d’Alembertian, the harmonic oscillator, and constant-coefficient linear
partial differential operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$.

In this talk, we will explore several variants of this result for homogeneous trees, where the Euclidean Laplacian is replaced by the combinatorial Laplacian
and the uniform boundedness condition is appropriately adjusted. We will then explore possible generalizations when the combinatorial Laplacian is substituted
with multipliers on homogeneous trees. After presenting the result in this broader context, we will narrow our focus to specific cases, including key examples
of multiplier operators such as the heat and Schr¨odinger operators, as well as ball and sphere averages of functions. The talk is based on a joint work with
Rudra P. Sarkar.
