This talk explores scalar and coupled systems of nonlocal conservation laws (hyperbolic partial differential equations) and their applications
in modeling real-world phenomena such as traffic flow and crowd dynamics. The nonlocal nature of these laws makes them particularly effective
in capturing dynamics where each individual or unit in the system moves based on its perception of density and its variations within a given
horizon or neighborhood. This makes them ideal for studying large-scale systems, such as urban traffic, opinion formation, or massive crowd
gatherings.

These partial differential equations often lack closed-form solutions, making it necessary to develop numerical algorithms that converge to
the entropy (physical) solution. To this end, we develop and present finite-volume schemes to approximate these governing PDEs. For practical
purposes, along with convergence, one also needs to investigate how errors depend on the mesh parameters. Thus, the talk focuses on establishing
the convergence and rate of convergence of finite-volume approximations to the entropy solution.

Numerical experiments will be presented to validate the theoretical findings, illustrate the convergence rates, and highlight the practical
relevance of these models.
