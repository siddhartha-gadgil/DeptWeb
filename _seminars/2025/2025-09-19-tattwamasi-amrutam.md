Let $X$ and $Y$ be $G$-spaces, where $G$ is a second-countable, locally compact group, and 
$G \curvearrowright X$ and $Y$ by homeomorphisms. A very well-studied question from the dynamics 
is to understand all intermediate factors of the form
\begin{circuitikz}[american]
X \times Y \arrow[rr, bend left=50, "\mathrm{Proj}_X"] \arrow[r] & Z \arrow[r] & X.
\end{circuitikz}
In particular, to find conditions on $G$, $X$, and $Y$ such that every such intermediate factor splits as 
a product of the form $X \times Y'$, where there is a continuous $G$-map $Y \to Y'$. 

Of course, we can also ask such a question in the measurable setup, where we replace topological compact spaces by measurable spaces.

<script src="https://i.upmath.me/latex.js"></script>
\begin{tikzcd}
(X,\mu) \times (Y,\nu) \arrow[rr, bend left=50, "\mathrm{Proj}_X"] \arrow[r] & (Z,\eta) \arrow[r] & (X,\mu)
\end{tikzcd}
</p>
When is $(Z,\eta) \cong (X,\mu) \times (Y',\nu')$, where there is a $G$-map $(Y,\nu)\to (Y',\nu')$?

Such results, known as \emph{Intermediate Factor Theorems}, have been at the heart of rigidity results, 
starting from Margulis to Nevo--Stuck--Zimmer to Bader--Shalom.

During this talk, we shall reformulate this problem in the $C^*$ and von Neumann algebraic language 
and then give some new results in this direction. Parts of them are based on joint work with 
Yongle Jiang and Shuoxing Zhou, respectively. 

No prior knowledge of any of these will be assumed during the talk.
