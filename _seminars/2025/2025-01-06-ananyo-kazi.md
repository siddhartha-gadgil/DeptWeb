In the theory of `$p$`-adic `$L$`-functions a `$p$`-adic Gross-Zagier formula gives interpretation to special values of `$p$`-adic `$L$`-functions outside the region of interpolation using `$p$`-adic integration. Seen as a first step towards "explicit reciprocity laws" they have important applications towards proving various instances of the Bloch-Kato conjecture, as in the work of Darmon–Rotger. We construct a `$p$`-adic twisted triple product `$L$`-function associated to finite slope families of Hilbert modular forms, assuming `$p$` unramified in the totally real fields. We use techniques of `$p$`-adic iteration of the Gauss–Manin connection on sheaves of nearly overconvergent modular forms, as developed by Andreatta–Iovita. In joint work with Ting-Han Huang, we prove a `$p$`-adic Gross-Zagier formula for this `$L$`-function for a pair of an elliptic modular form and a quadratic Hilbert modular form. This generalises work of Blanco-Chacon and Fornea for the case of Hida families, and we overcome a technical assumption in their work of `$p$` being split in the quadratic field.
