A recurring theme in probability theory is that of universality: when extremely different looking systems have the same large scale statistical behavior. In the last
few decades, an important new universality class has been discovered, called the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. However, the universality is only putative
as only a handful of "metric" type models have been shown to lie in it in the strongest sense. 

In this talk we will discuss a recent proof of membership in the KPZ class of the first non-metric type of model, namely the colored stochastic six-vertex model. The
model arises naturally in probability theory and has connections to many areas of statistical physics and quantum integrable systems; e.g., the first form of the
six-vertex model was introduced by Pauling in 1935 to model the crystal structure of ice. The Yang-Baxter equation and line ensembles (collections of random
non-intersecting curves) will play fundamental roles in our discussion, but no prior background will be assumed. This is based on joint work with Amol Aggarwal and
Ivan Corwin.
