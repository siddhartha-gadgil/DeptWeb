A fundamental tool in analyzing the special fiber of Shimura varieties is the Newton stratification, indexed by the set `$B(G, \mu)$` of neutral acceptable Frobenius-twisted conjugacy classes. In several key cases, the unique closed Newton stratum - a generalization of the supersingular locus in the Siegel case - admits an explicit description as a union of  Deligne-Lusztig varieties. Such descriptions have played a pivotal role in applications to the Kudla-Rapoport program, the Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma, and certain cases of the Tate conjecture. Note that this closed stratum corresponds to the unique smallest element of `$B(G, \mu)$`, and by Rapoport-Zink uniformization, each Newton stratum is modeled by a corresponding (closed) affine Deligne-Lusztig variety `$X(\mu, b)$`, a group-theoretic construction reflecting the local structure.

In this talk, we consider the opposite extreme: the maximal element `$b_{\mu,\max}$` of `$B(G, \mu)$`. I will present a dimension formula  for the affine Deligne--Lusztig variety `$X(\mu, b_{\mu,\max})$` and discuss the structure of its  irreducible components. In particular, we will see certain naturally occurring iterated fibrations over Deligne--Lusztig varieties among these components. As an application of our work, we obtain a new proof of the classification of when `$X(\mu,b)$` has dimension zero in full generality.
