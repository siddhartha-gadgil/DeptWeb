We prove an inductive formula to construct a path from the highest weight element to any given vertex in the crystal graph of the polytope realization of the
Kirillov–Reshetikhin crystal $KR^{i,m}$ of type $A$ introduced by Kus in 2013. For $i \leq 2$ or $i \geq n-1$, we provide explicit formulas of the same by only
using the lowering crystal operators and in those cases, using these paths, we determine the explicit image of any polytope under the affine crystal isomorphisms
between the polytope and the tableau realizations of the Kirillov–Reshetikhin crystals. This is a joint work with Dipnit Biswas.
