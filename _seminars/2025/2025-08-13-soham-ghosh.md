I will present a (cohomological) Fourier-Mukai transform for tropical abelian varieties and provide some applications, including a generalized
Poincaré formula for any nondegenerate line bundle on tropical abelian varieties, generalizing Beauville's identities for complex abelian varieties.
Based on joint work with Farbod Shokrieh.
