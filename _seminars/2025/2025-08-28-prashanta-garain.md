We study a class of quasi-linear elliptic equations that incorporate both local and nonlocal components. Our focus is on exploring various regularity properties of their
solutions. In particular, we address local boundedness, Harnackâ€™s inequality, and other qualitative features. The results reflect the interplay between the local and
nonlocal aspects of the equations.
