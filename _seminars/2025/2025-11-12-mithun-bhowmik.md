In this talk, we will discuss a quantitative uniqueness theorem for quasi-analytic functions defined on compact, connected Lie groups $G$ and on homogeneous spaces $G/H$,
where $H$ is any closed subgroup of $G$. This result extends classical Logvinenko-Sereda-type theorems to the setting of quasi-analytic functions on compact Lie groups and
their homogeneous spaces. 

The quasi-analytic class of functions is defined using iterates of the Casimir operator on $G$. This construction is justified by establishing that every function in this
class possesses the strong unique continuation property. In particular, our result extends to a result of P. Chernoff (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 1975) to the framework of
compact Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces.
