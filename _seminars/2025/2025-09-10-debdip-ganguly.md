This talk is devoted to the study of weighted Poincaré inequalities on hyperbolic space, where the weight functions depend on a scaling parameter.
This leads to a new family of scale-dependent Poincaré inequalities with Gaussian type measure on the hyperbolic space. As a result, we derive both
scale-dependent and scale-invariant $L^2$-stability results for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
