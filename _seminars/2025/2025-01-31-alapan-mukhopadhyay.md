Frobenius or the $p$-th power map is crucial in defining singularity
classes in characteristic $p > 0$, especially those appearing in the
birational classification of algebraic varieties. On the other hand, the
obstruction to smoothness is homological, according to a celebrated
theorem of Serre. In this talk, we will show that Frobenius witnesses
this homological obstruction to smoothness. This will explain the
effectiveness of Frobenius in detecting singularities, from a homological
point of view. The key will be to produce (explicit) generators of the
bounded derived category of a variety in characteristic $p > 0$ from
perfect complexes using the Frobenius pushforward functor. Our results
recover earlier characterizations of smoothness using Frobenius, such as
Kunz's theorem. Part of the talk will report a joint work with Matthew
Ballard, Patrick Lank, Srikanth Iyengar and Josh Pollitz.
