For a matrix $A \in M_m(\mathbb{C})$ and $1 \le j \le m$, let $ s_j(A^n)
$ denote the $j^\mathrm{th}$ largest singular value of $A^n$. A classical
result due to Yamamoto (1967) asserts that $\lim_{n \to \infty}
s_j(A^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$ is equal to the $j^\mathrm{th}$-largest
eigenvalue-modulus of $A$, counted with multiplicity. Nayak (2023)
generalized this result significantly by showing that for $A \in
M_m(\mathbb C)$, the sequence $\{|A^n|^\frac{1}{n}\}$, where
$|A|:=(A^*A)^\frac{1}{2}$, converges to a positive-semidefinite matrix,
whose $j^\mathrm{th}$-largest eigenvalue is equal to the
$j^\mathrm{th}$-largest eigenvalue-modulus of $A$, and in fact provided
an explicit description of the limit.

In this talk, we will extend the Yamamoto--Nayak result to the context of
{\it spectral operators} on a (infinite-dimensional) complex Hilbert
space $\mathscr H$. Specifically, we will show that the  {\it normalized
power sequence}, $\{ |A^n|^{\frac{1}{n}} \}_{n \in \mathbb N}$, of a
spectral operator $A \in \mathscr B(\mathscr H)$ converges in norm, and
provide an explicit description of the limiting positive operator. This
framework not only generalizes Nayak's earlier result to
infinite-dimensional settings, but also offers an alternative and
streamlined proof of the finite-dimensional case.
