I will begin by reviewing some basic facts about vector bundles on the
Grassmannian $Gr(r,n)$ and state the Borel--Weil--Bott theorem.
The space of maps from a smooth projective curve $C$ to $Gr(r,n)$ is
compactified by the Quot scheme. In this talk, we define $K$-theoretic
invariants involving Euler characteristics of vector bundles over these
Quot schemes. We show that these invariants naturally fit into a
topological quantum field theory. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
genus-zero invariants recover the quantum $K$-ring of $Gr(r,n)$, and
provide a novel approach for deriving explicit formulas.
