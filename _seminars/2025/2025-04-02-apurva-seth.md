Given real numbers $0\leq r' \leq r\leq \infty$, and $d\in \mathbb{Z}\_{>0}$, in this talk, we shall construct a simple unital $C^*$-algebra $A$
of stable rank one and an action $\alpha \colon \mathbb{Z}^d \to \text{Aut}(A)$ such that the radius of comparison of $A$ is $r$, while the
radius of comparison of the crossed product $A\rtimes_\alpha\mathbb{Z}^d$ is $r'$.
This talk is based on joint work with Ilan Hirshberg and M. Ali Asadi-Vasfi.
