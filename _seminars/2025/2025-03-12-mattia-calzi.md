Clark (or Aleksandrov–Clark) measures are a powerful tool for the study of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disc in $\mathbb{C}$. This class of measures
was recently extended to the unit ball (in two different ways) and to the unit polydisc in $\mathbb{C}^n$, and then also to general circular bounded symmetric domains.
The talk will review some recent advances and open problems concerning Clark measures on symmetric domains. Particular attention will be devoted to some specific
domains, such as the unit ball and the polydisc, as well as to the class of Clark measures associated with rational inner functions.
