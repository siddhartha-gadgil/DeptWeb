In this talk, we examine a free boundary value problem that models the motion of a piston interacting with a viscous compressible fluid.
The fluid dynamics are governed by the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations, where the viscosity coefficient may be
degenerate. The motion of the piston (point mass) is coupled with the fluid through Newton's second law. We will discuss the existence
and uniqueness of a global-in-time solution to this initial boundary value problem and explore the large-time behavior of the system.
