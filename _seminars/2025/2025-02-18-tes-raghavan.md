An $m \times n$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is called a nonnegative matrix ($\geq 0$) when $a_{ij} \geq 0\ \forall i=1,\dots,m; j = 1,\dots,n$. The matrix
$A$ is called totally nonnegative (TN) if all minors of all order are nonnegative. The matrix $A$ is called totally positive (TP) if all minors of
order $q$, $q = 1, 2, \dots, \min(m, n)$ are strictly positive. When $m=n$, the matrix $A$ is called oscillatory if $A$ is TN and for some power
$k$ $A^k$ is TP.

While the Russian school headed by M.G. Krein and F.R. Gantmacher were motivated by problems of small oscillations and vibrations of mechanical
systems that led to the study of the spectral properties of oscillatory matrices, the American school was headed by I.J. Schoenberg and A.M. Whitney
who concentrated on the sign variation properties of arbitrary vectors $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and their image $Ay$ under TN matrices. Influenced by
the works of Krein and Schoenberg, Samuel Karlin noticed its applicability to the study of the properties of the transition function of strong
Markov processes, and their intimate connections to the count of disjoint paths among paths in a directed graph without cycles. Yet another application
appears in statistical decision theory. Virtually many standard one parameter family of probability density functions possess variation diminishing
properties. Extensions of the Perron Frobenius theorem to Positive operators by M.G. Krein and M.A. Rutman, are also extendable to the study of
totally positive operators.
