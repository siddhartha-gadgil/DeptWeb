A free-by-cyclic group is a semi-direct product of a free group with the group of integers Alternatively, a free-by-cyclic group can be viewed as the mapping torus of a
free group automorphism. In this talk, we will see that such a group can in fact fiber in multiple ways. We will then consider the properties of different monodromies that
are invariants of the group. This is joint work with Spencer Dowdall, Yassine Geurch, Jean Pierre Mutanguha and Caglar Uyanik.
