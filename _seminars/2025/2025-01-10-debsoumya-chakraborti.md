A key objective of extremal combinatorics is to investigate various
conditions on combinatorial structures (such as graphs, set systems, and
simplicial complexes) that guarantee the existence of specific
substructures. In this talk, I will concentrate on two central topics
within this theme of extremal combinatorics:
1. Tur√°n problems and
2. Embedding spanning subgraphs.

I will begin with a gentle introduction to the first topic, highlighting
a few fundamental questions in the field. In this context, I will
introduce the Erd&ouml;s--Sauer problem that asks for the maximum
possible number of edges that an $n$-vertex graph can have without
containing an $r$-regular subgraph. The problem had seen no progress
since Pyber's work in 1985 until recently when Janzer and Sudakov
resolved this problem up to a multiplicative constant depending on $r$.
We resolve the Erd&ouml;s--Sauer problem up to an absolute constant
factor (not depending on $r$) as follows. There exists an absolute
constant $C$ such that the following holds. For each positive integer
$r$, there exists some $n_0=n_0(r)$ such that if $n\geq n_0$, then every
$n$-vertex graph with at least $Cr^2n\log \log n$ edges contains an
$r$-regular subgraph. Moreover, we show this to be tight up to the value
of $C$.

Next, I will transition to the second topic, starting with two classical
results on embedding the Hamilton cycle (a cycle that visits every vertex
exactly once):
1. Dirac's theorem, which establishes a sharp minimum degree condition
on a graph to ensure the existence of a Hamilton cycle, and
2. Theorems on various orientations of Hamilton cycles in tournaments.

In the last decade, extending subgraph embedding problems to the setting
of transversals over a collection of graphs has sparked significant
interest in the literature. I will introduce this concept and then
discuss the transversal generalizations of (1) and (2). Some of these
include results from my own work in various papers.
