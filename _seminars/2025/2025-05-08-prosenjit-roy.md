Boundary Hardy inequality is a classical result [1980s] which states that
if $1 < p < \infty$ and   $\Omega$  is a bounded Lipschitz domain in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, then

\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)|^{p}}{\delta^{p}\_{\Omega}(x)}  dx \leq
C\int_{\Omega} |\nabla u(x) |^{p}dx,  \forall \ u \in
C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega),
\end{equation}

where $\delta_\Omega(x)$ is the distance
function from $\partial\Omega$. B. Dyda generalised the above inequality
to the fractional setting, which says, for $sp >1$ and $s\in (0,1)$

\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)|^{p}}{\delta_{\Omega}^{sp}(x)}  dx \leq C
\int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}}{|x-y|^{d+sp}} dxdy,
\ \forall \ u \in C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega).
\end{equation}

The first and the second inequality is not true for $p=1$ and $sp=1$
respectively. In this talk, I will present the  appropriate inequalities
for the  critical cases:  $p=1$ for the first and $sp= 1$ for the second
inequality. If time, permits I will touch upon another related inequality
called  Michael-Simmon-Sobolev inequality.

This is a part of the joint work with Adimuthi, Purbita Jana and Vivek Sahu.
