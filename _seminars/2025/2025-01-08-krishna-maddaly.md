A point interaction with one center of interaction is a model that informally has infinite potential at one point. We consider a random infinite center point
interaction model and show that the time average up to time T of the time evolved position operator grows with time. We explain the significance of such a
result. This is joint work with Peter Hislop and Werner Kirsch.
