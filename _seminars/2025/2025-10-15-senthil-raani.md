A Szemer√©di-type theorem proved by Jean Bourgain (1986) asserts that any subset of the Euclidean plane with positive upper density contains all sufficiently large
distances. After briefly discussing his techniques and a related example by Alex Rice (2020), we explore analogous statements in other settings, with particular
focus on the Heisenberg group framework.
