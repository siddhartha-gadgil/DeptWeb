Fractional Sobolev space is a natural space coming from the
trace results. It has three parameters namely. $0<s<1$, $p>1$, and $\Omega$
a bounded domain in $n$ dimensional Euclidean space. It was shown
that for $sp \neq 1$ it can be embedded in weighted Lebesgue space
with weight the distance from the boundary. It fails when $sp =1$. Here
we deal with the critical case $sp=1$ and get the optimal embedding.
This is a joint work with Prosenjit Roy, Purbita and Prosenjit Roy and Vivek Sahu.
