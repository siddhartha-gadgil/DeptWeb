In this talk, we discuss about the $L^{p_1}(G) \times L^{p_2}(G)$ to $L^{p}(G)$ boundedness of bilinear Bochner-Riesz means, $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$
associated to the sub-Laplacians, $\mathcal{L}$ on Métivier groups, $G$ with $(p_1,p_2,p)$ satisfies the Hölder's relation, that is
$1/p = 1/p_1 + 1/p_2$ and $1\leq p_1, p_2 \leq \infty$. We prove that $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$ is bounded for $\alpha > \alpha(p_1, p_2)$ where
$\alpha(p_1, p_2)$ is in terms of $d:=d_1+d_2$, the topological dimension of $G$, which is strictly smaller than the homogeneous dimension
$Q:=d_1+2d_2$ of $G$. This talk is based on joint work with Sayan Bagchi and Md Nurul Molla.
