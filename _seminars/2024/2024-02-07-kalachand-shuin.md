In this talk, we will explore the $L^{p}$-boundedness of both bilinear and multilinear maximal averages defined on non-degenerate
hypersurfaces. Additionally, we will delve into the $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)\times L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)\times\cdots\times L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)
\to L^{2/m}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ estimates for $m$-linear maximal averages, focusing on hypersurfaces with $1\leq \kappa < md-1$ non-zero
principal curvatures.
