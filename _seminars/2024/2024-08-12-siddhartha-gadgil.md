A couple of years ago Ian Agol proved a long-standing conjecture showing that a relation called "Ribbon concordance" on knots is a partial order. The proof was a six page paper involving a blend of topology, combinatorial group theory and real algebraic geometry, with ribbon concordance implying a relation between representation varieties. In this talk I describe Agol's proof and some background results.
