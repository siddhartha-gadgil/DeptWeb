In this talk, the speaker considers two types of maximal operators given by Fourier multipliers, and suggests criteria for Fourier multipliers so that the associated maximal operators
are bounded on $L^p$ for each $p$. In other words, we first consider maximal operators given by taking supremum over $t > 0$ where $t$ is a dilation factor of Fourier multipliers,
$m(t\xi)$. The condition for $m$ may be understood as a vector-valued analogue of the H&ouml;rmander--Mikhlin multiplier theorem. For the second type of maximal operators, we take the
supremum over $t \in E$ with $0 \leq \dim(E) < 1$. Together with the dimension of $E$, the condition for $m$ associated with the first maximal operators is still valid for the second
maximal operators.
