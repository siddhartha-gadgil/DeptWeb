This talk considers an optimal control problem governed by a semi-linear heat equation within a two-dimensional pillar-type domain
$\Omega_{\epsilon}$ .The problem features highly oscillatory periodic coefficients in both the state equation and the cost function
$A_\epsilon$ and $B_\epsilon$. Our objective is to analyze the convergence of the optimal solutions (as $\epsilon \to 0$ ) and to
identify the limit of the optimal control problem in a fixed domain that effectively captures the impact of the oscillatory coefficients.
