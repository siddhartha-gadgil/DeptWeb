Paul Lévy studied in the 1940s and 50s the area enclosed by paths of the planar Brownian motion, extending Green’s theorem to stochastic curves and line integrals. In this talk, I will discuss some properties of this quantity, known as the stochastic area, which has been re-discovered in statistical physics as a measure or metric of irreversibility in stochastic processes. I will focus on calculating the full distribution of the stochastic area using techniques from large deviation theory.
