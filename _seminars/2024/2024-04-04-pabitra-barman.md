Let $S_{g,k}$ be a connected oriented surface of negative Euler characteristic and $\rho_1,\ \rho_2:\pi_1(S_{g,k}) \rightarrow PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$
be two representations. $\rho_2$ is said to dominate $\rho_1$ if there exists $\lambda \le 1$ such that
$\ell_{\rho_1}(\gamma) \le \lambda \cdot \ell_{\rho_2}(\gamma)$ for all $\gamma \in \pi_1(S_{g,k})$, where $\ell_{\rho}(\gamma)$ denotes the
translation length of $\rho(\gamma)$ in $\mathbb{H}^3$. In 2016, Deroin--Tholozan showed that for a closed surface $S$ and a non-Fuchsian representation
$\rho : \pi_1(S_{g,k}) \rightarrow PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$, there exists a Fuchsian representation $j : \pi_1(S_{g,k}) \rightarrow PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$ that
strictly dominates $\rho$. In 2023, Gupta--Su proved a similar result for punctured surfaces, where the representations lie in the same relative
representation variety. Here, we generalize these results to the case of higher-rank representations.

For a representation $\rho : \pi_1(S_{g,k}) \rightarrow PSL_n(\mathbb{C})$, the Hilbert length of a curve $\gamma\in \pi_1(S_{g,k})$ for $n >2$ is
defined as
\begin{equation}
\ell_{\rho}(\gamma):= \ln \Bigg| \frac{\lambda_n}{\lambda_1} \Bigg|,
\end{equaton}
where $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda_1$ are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $\rho(\gamma)$ in modulus respectively. We show that for any generic
representation $\rho : \pi_1 (S_{g,k}) \rightarrow PSL_n(\mathbb{C})$, there is a Hitchin representation $j : \pi_1 (S_{g,k}) \rightarrow PSL_n(\mathbb{R})$
that dominates $\rho$ in the Hilbert length spectrum. The proof uses Fock-Goncharov coordinates on the moduli space of framed $PSL_n(\mathbb{C})$
representation. Weighted planar networks and the Collatz--Wielandt formula for totally positive matrices play a crucial role.

Let $X_n$ be the symmetric space of $PSL_n(\mathbb{C})$. The translation length of $A\in PSL_n(\mathbb{C})$ in $X_n$ is given as
\begin{equation}
\tau(A)= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\log |\lambda_i(A)|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_i(A)$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. We show that the same $j$ dominates $\rho$ with respect to the translation length at the origin as well.
Lindstr&ouml;m's Lemma for planar networks and Weyl's Majorant Theorem are some of the key ingredients of the proof.

In both cases, if $S_{g,k}$ is a punctured surface, then $j$ lies in the same relative representation variety as $\rho$.
