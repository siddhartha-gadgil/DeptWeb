Recently it was observed that an important algorithm in quantum signal processing (QSP) is the same as what is
called elsewhere the nonlinear Fourier transform (NLFT). This has led to a new provably stable algorithm to
compute the tuning parameters for this quantum algorithm. We will discuss QSP, NLFT, and the algorithm.
This is joint work with Michel Alexis and Gevorg Mnatsakanyan and in part also with Lin Lin and Jiasu Wang.
