We can apply Obstruction bundle gluing introduced by Hutchings and Taubes in Embedded contact homology to the setting of Morse theory. 
The goal is to understand this gluing technique in a simpler set up and analyse Morse theory with assumptions weaker than Smale condition 
on surfaces. This is work in progress with Yuan Yao.
