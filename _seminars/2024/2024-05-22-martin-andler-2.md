In the 1950s, topologists introduced the notion of equivariant cohomology
$H_G(E)$ for a topological space $E$ with an action by a compact group
$G$. If the action is free, $H_G(E)$ should be $H(E/G)$, and be computed
using de Rham cohomology. In 1950, even before the concept of equivariant
cohomology had been formulated, Henri Cartan introduced a complex of
equivariant differential forms for a compact Lie group acting on a
differential manifold $E$, and proved a result amounting to stating that
the cohomology of that complex computes $H_G(E)$. In 1999, Guillemin and
Sternberg reformulated Cartan's work in terms of a supersymmetric
extension of the Lie algebra of $G$.

Our aim is to reconsider such considerations, by replacing vector spaces
by a $k$-linear symmetric monoidal category, requiring that this category
contain an odd unit to account for the supersymmetric dimension plus some
further properties, and considering modules of a rigid Lie algebra object
in that category. In that context, we obtain a version of Koszul's
homotopy isomorphism theorem, and recover as a consequence some known
results as the acyclicity of the Koszul resolution. (Joint work with
Siddhartha Sahi.)
