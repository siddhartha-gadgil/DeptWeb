We will use the Alexandrov moving plane method to prove radial symmetry of positive finite energy solutions of a quasilinear
elliptic equation arising from the Poincare Sobolev inequality in the Hyperbolic space. We will also discuss the existence
and non-existence results in some particular cases.
