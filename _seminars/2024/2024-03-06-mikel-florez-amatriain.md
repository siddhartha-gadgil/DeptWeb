In this talk, I will report a work in progress in which we show $L^p$ bounds for singular integral operators formed by $(n-1)$-dimensional
Hörmander-Mihlin multipliers. In our case, the multipliers act depending on $(n-1)$-dimensional variable subspaces, which depend only on
the first $n-1$ variables.

We prove $L^p$ boundedness for these operators for $p>3/2$. Assuming that the frequency support of the function is contained in an annulus,
we can show $L^p$ boundedness for $p>1$.
