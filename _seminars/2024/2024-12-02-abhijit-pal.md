Quasi-isometric classification of groups is one of the central problems  in Geometric group theory. In this talk, we will be
focusing on quasi-isometries obtained from a homeomorphism between boundaries of hyperbolic groups and relatively hyperbolic
groups. Paulin proved that if the Gromov boundaries of two hyperbolic groups are quasi-Mobius equivalence, then those two
hyperbolic groups are quasi-isometric. In this talk,  we will extend Paulin's results to relatively hyperbolic groups by
introducing the notion of 'relative quasi-Mobius maps' between their Bowditch boundaries.
