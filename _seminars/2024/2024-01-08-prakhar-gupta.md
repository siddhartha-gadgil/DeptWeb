In this talk, I will describe a complete geodesic metric $d_p$ on the finite energy space $\mathcal{E}^p(X,\theta)$ for $p\geq 1$ where 
$\theta$ represents a big cohomology class. This work generalizes the complete geodesic metrics in the Kahler setting to the big setting. 
When p=1, the metric $d_1$ in the Kahler setting has found various applications in the understanding of Kahler-Einstein and Constant 
Scalar Curvature Kahler metrics. In this talk, I'll describe how to construct the metric and explain some properties that could have useful
applications in the future.
