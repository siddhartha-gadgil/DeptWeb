Given two distinct cuspidal automorphic `$L$`-functions (of `$\mathrm{GL}_n$` and `$\mathrm{GL}_m$` over `$\mathbb{Q}$`) one expects that their quotients will have infinitely poles, but this is surprisingly hard to prove. In this talk, I will discuss my recent work on the case `$m=n-2$` and the primitivity of the `$L$`-functions of cuspidal automorphic `$L$`-functions of `$\mathrm{GL}_3$`. These methods also work for Artin `$L$`-functions and, more generally, for the `$L$`-functions of Galois representations under further hypotheses.
