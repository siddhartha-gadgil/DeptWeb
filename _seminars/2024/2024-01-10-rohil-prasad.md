This is joint work in progress with Dan Cristofaro-Gardiner. We explore the topological dynamics of Reeb flows beyond periodic orbits 
and find the following rather general phenomenon. For any Reeb flow for a torsion contact structure on a closed 3-manifold, 
any point is arbitrarily close to a proper compact invariant subset of the flow. Such a statement is false if the invariant subset 
is required to be a periodic orbit. Stronger results can also be proved that parallel theorems of Le Calvez-Yoccoz, Franks, and 
Salazar for homeomorphisms of the 2-sphere. In fact, we can also extend their results to Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of closed surfaces 
of any genus.
