What happens to an $L_p$ function when one truncates its Fourier
transform to a domain? This is in the root of foundational problems in
harmonic analysis. Fefferman's celebrated theorem for the ball (1971)
imposes that, to preserve $L_p$-integrability, the boundary of such
domain must be flat. What if we truncate on a curved space like a Lie
group? And if we truncate the entries of a given matrix? What happens
with the singular numbers of it or with its Schatten $p$-norm? We fully
characterize the local geometry of such $L_p$-preserving truncations for
these (apparently unrelated) problems, in terms of a surprisingly lax
notion of boundary flatness. The matrix ones are all diffeomorphic
variations of a fundamental example: the triangular projection. The Lie
group ones are all modeled on one of three fundamental examples: the
classical Hilbert transform, and two new examples of Hilbert transforms
that we call affine and projective. This vastly generalizes Fefferman's
theorem to nontrigonometric and noncommutative scenarios. It confirms the
intuition that Schur multipliers share profound similarities with
Euclidean Fourier multipliers -- even in the lack of a Fourier transform
connection -- and complete, for Lie groups, a longstanding search of
Fourier $L_p$-idempotents. Joint work with M. de la Salle and E. Tablate.
