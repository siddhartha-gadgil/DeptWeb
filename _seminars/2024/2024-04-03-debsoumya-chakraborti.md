Consider a multipartite graph $G$ with maximum degree at most $n-o(n)$,
parts $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ have size $|V_i|=n$, and every vertex has at most
$o(n)$ neighbors in any part $V_i$. Loh and Sudakov proved that any such
$G$ has an independent set, referred to as an 'independent transversal',
which contains exactly one vertex from each part $V_i$. They further
conjectured that the vertex set of $G$ can be decomposed into pairwise
disjoint independent transversals. We resolve this conjecture
approximately by showing that $G$ contains $n-o(n)$ pairwise disjoint
independent transversals. As applications, we give approximate answers to
questions on packing list colorings and multipartite
Hajnal-Szemer&eacute;di theorem. We use probabilistic methods, including
a 'two-layer nibble' argument. This talk is based on joint work with Tuan
Tran.
