We prove a bijection between the branching models of Kwon and Sundaram, conjectured by Lenart--Lecouvey.
To do so, we use a symmetry of the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients in terms of the hive model. Along
the way, we introduce a new branching rule with flagged hives. 
This talk is based on a joint work with Dr. Jacinta Torres.
