We discuss an algebraic version of Schoenberg's celebrated theorem [_Duke Math. J._, 1942] characterizing entrywise matrix transforms that preserve positive definiteness.
Compared to the classical real and complex settings, we consider matrices with entries in a finite field and obtain a complete characterization of such preservers for
matrices of a fixed dimension. When the dimension of the matrices is at least 3, we prove that, surprisingly, the positivity preservers are precisely the positive multiples
of the field's automorphisms. Our work makes crucial use of the well-known character-sum bound due to Weil, and of a result of Carlitz [_Proc. Amer. Math. Soc._, 1960] that
leads to characterizing the automorphisms of Paley graphs. This is joint with Dominique Guillot and Himanshu Gupta.
