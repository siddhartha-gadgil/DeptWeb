This talk focuses on the asymptotic analysis of an optimal control problem constrained by the stationary Stokes equations
within a periodically perforated domain. The problem involves distributive controls applied to the interior region, where
the Stokes operator includes oscillating coefficients for the state equations. We aim to demonstrate the convergence of
the solutions of the considered optimal control problem to those of the limit OCP governed by the stationary Stokes equations
and to establish the convergence of the associated cost functional.
