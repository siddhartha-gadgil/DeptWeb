Random processes with strong memory and/or self-excitation properties arise naturally in various disciplines including physics, economics, biology, engineering,
geology, etc. Memory can be multifaceted and can arise due to interactions of more than one underlying phenomena. Many of these processes exhibit superdiffusive
growth due to the effect of self-excitation and also Eulerian behaviour from time to time. In order to model such situations, two statistical physicists Schütz
and Trimper (2004) introduced a class of processes called Elephant Random Walks, in which the random walker remembers the past steps and repeats them with some
probability. In the first half of this talk, we shall investigate the asymptotic properties of a family of elephant random walks that exhibits Eulerian behaviour
on the two-dimensional lattice. Depending on the values of its parameters, we shall observe a nonlinear phase transition for these random walks from diffusive to
superdiffusive regimes. 

In the second half, we shall discuss a class of one-dimensional such models called “elephant random walk with n memory channels” introduced in a recent paper by
another statistical physicist Saha (2022). In these models the information of $n$ previous steps from the walker’s entire history is needed to decide the future
step. The aforementioned work carried out a bunch of calculations, and conjectured a phase transition from diffusive to superdiffusive regime based on some numerical
computations in the $n=2$ case. We have been able to prove these conjectures rigorously and establish a few new transition boundaries beyond the predicted ones. 

I shall present the results mentioned above along with several open problems. Special care will be taken so that students can follow both halves of this talk. Most
of the notions will be introduced and nothing more than basic probability will be prerequisite for this talk. (Based on collaborations with A. Haldar, K. Maulik,
S. S. Manna and T. Sadhukhan.)
