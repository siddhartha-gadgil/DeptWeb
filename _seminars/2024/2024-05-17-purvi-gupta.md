Given a box packed with identical cubes of cheese, what is the maximum damage one can cause with a single straight cut through the box? This seemingly simple puzzle represents an old but recurrent mathematical theme that slices through numerous fields such as number theory, functional analysis, probability theory, and computational complexity theory. The cross-sections of convex bodies hold many mysteries, some of which continue to puzzle mathematicians today. We will focus on the deceptively simple case of the cube to demonstrate some of these ideas and open questions. No cheese will be harmed in the making of this talk.
