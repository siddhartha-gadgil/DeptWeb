Teichmuller space admits several ray structures, such as the Teichmuller geodesic ray, Thurston stretch ray, harmonic map (dual) ray, 
grafting ray, etc. In the first part of this talk, we will depict harmonic map ray structures on Teichmuller space as a geometric 
transition between Teichmuller ray structures and Thurston geodesic ray structures. In particular, by appropriately degenerating the 
source of a harmonic map between hyperbolic surfaces, the harmonic map rays through the target converge to a Thurston geodesic; by 
appropriately degenerating the target of the harmonic map, those harmonic map dual rays through the domain converge to a Teichmuller 
geodesic. In the second part, we will discuss applications to the Thurston metric.  This is a joint work with Michael Wolf.
