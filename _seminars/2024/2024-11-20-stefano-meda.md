We consider the centred and the uncentred Hardy--Littlewood maximal operators on metric measure spaces with exponential volume
growth and "locally bounded geometry". We discuss the problem of finding the optimal range of $p$'s such that either the centred or the
uncentred HL maximal operator is bounded on $L^p$.

The prototypes of the metric measure spaces we consider are the
symmetric spaces of the noncompact type and the homogeneous trees,
where sharp $L^p$ estimates on the HL operators are available in the literature.

We shall show that interesting phenomena arise when homogeneous trees are replaced by non-homegeoeus ones, and noncompact
symmetric spaces by Riemannian manifolds with pinched negative sectional curvature.
