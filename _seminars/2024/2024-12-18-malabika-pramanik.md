For millennia, the Pythagorean theorem has provided a simple yet profound
formula for computing distances between points. Remarkably, this timeless
concept continues to captivate mathematicians, inspiring new discoveries
and posing challenging open questions.

A central theme in this journey involves distance sets: collections of
distances determined by points in a set. How large can a distance set be if
the set of points it comes from is "large"? How does the structure of a set
shape the distances it contains? These questions bridge classical geometry
and modern mathematics, with applications reaching far beyond disciplinary
boundaries.

This two-part series explores the surprising depth of these problems. The
first talk introduces key ideas and landmark results in a way accessible to
a general audience, requiring no advanced mathematical background. The
second talk delves into analytical perspectives, uncovering deeper
mathematical mysteries for those eager to explore the intricate beauty of
this field.
