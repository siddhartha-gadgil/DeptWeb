We sketch a strategy to prove the Tate conjecture on algebraic cycles
for a good amount of quaternionic Shimura varieties.
A key point is a twisted adjoint L-value formula relative to each
quaternion algebra  $D/F$  for a totally real field   $F$
and its scalar extension  B=D\otimes_F E$  for a totally real quadratic
extension  $E_{/F}$.
The theta base-change lift  $\fc$  of a Hilbert modular form  $f$  to
$B^\times$  has period integral over the Shimura subvariety
$Sh_D\subset Sh_B$
given by  $L(1,Ad(f)\otimes\left(\frac{E/F}{}\right))\ne0$; so,
$Sh_D$  gives rise
to a non-trivial Tate cycle  in  $H^{2r}(Sh_B,\Q_l(r))$  for  $r=\dim
Sh_D=\dim Sh_B/2$.
