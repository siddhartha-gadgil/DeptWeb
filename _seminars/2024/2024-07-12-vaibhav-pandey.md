Consider a reductive linear algebraic group $G$ acting linearly on a
polynomial ring $S$ over an infinite field. Objects of broad interest in
commutative algebra, representation theory, and algebraic geometry like
generic determinantal rings, Pl&uuml;cker coordinate rings of
Grassmannians, symmetric determinantal rings, rings defined by Pfaffians
of alternating matrices etc. arise as the invariant rings $S^G$ of such
group actions.

In characteristic zero, reductive groups are linearly reductive and
therefore the embedding of the invariant ring $S^G$ in the ambient
polynomial ring $S$ splits. This explains a number of good
algebro-geometric properties of the invariant ring in characteristic
zero. In positive characteristic, reductive groups are typically no
longer linearly reductive. We determine, for the natural actions of the
classical groups, precisely when $S^G$ splits from $S$ in positive
characteristic.

This is joint work with Melvin Hochster, Jack Jeffries, and Anurag K.
Singh.
