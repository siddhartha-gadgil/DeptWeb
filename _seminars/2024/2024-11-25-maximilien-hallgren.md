By the compactness theory of Bamler, any finite time singularity of the Kahler-Ricci flow is modeled on a singular Kahler-Ricci soliton, 
and such solitons are infinitesimally metric cones. In this talk, we will see that these cones are normal affine algebraic varieties, 
using a new method for proving Hormander-type L^2 estimates on singular shrinking solitons.
