  Focuses on two interacting particle systems with inhomogeneous rates on the finite ring with site-dependent rates.
  Systems: Totally Asymmetric Zero Range Process (TAZRP) and PushTASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process)
  Presents results on the interchangeability of particle path distributions under rate permutations.
  Proofs leverage Weber's theorem for exponential queues.
  Joint work with O. Mandelshtam and J. Martin (arXiv:2209.09859, Math. Z., to appear) and with J. Martin (arXiv:2310.09740).
