This will be a broad discussion on a few different types of Fourier uncertainty principles for bandlimited functions (i.e. functions that have Fourier
transforms compactly supported), and their connections to multiplication operators in certain Hilbert spaces of entire functions. Some of these problems
are related to applications in analysis, PDEs and number theory, and I might describe a few of these if time permits. The talk should be accessible to a
broad audience.
