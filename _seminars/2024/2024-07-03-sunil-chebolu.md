Let $F$ be a field that has a primitive $p$-th root of unity. According
to the Bloch&ndash;Kato conjecture, now a theorem  by Voevodsky and Rost,
the norm-residue map
\begin{equation}
k_\*(F)/pk_\*(F) \rightarrow H^*(F, \mathbb{F}_p)
\end{equation}
from the reduced Milnor $K$-theory to the Galois cohomology of $F$ is an
isomorphism of $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras.

This isomorphism gives a presentation of the rather mysterious Galois
cohomology ring through generators and relations. In joint work with Jan
Minac, Cihan Okay, Andy Schultz, and Charlotte Ure, we have obtained a
second cohomology refinement of the Bloch&ndash;Kato conjecture. Using
this we can characterize the maximal $p$-extension of $F$, as the
"decomposing field" for the cohomology of the absolute Galois group.
