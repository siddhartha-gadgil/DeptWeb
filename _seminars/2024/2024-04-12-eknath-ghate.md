It is an open problem to describe the shape of the reductions of local
Galois representations attached to cusp forms at primes away from the
level, or more generally, the shape of the reductions of two-dimensional
crystalline representations. Partial results go back to Deligne, Fontaine
and Edixhoven. One folklore conjecture (attributed to Breuil, Buzzard and
Emerton) is that if the weight is even and the slope is fractional, then
the reduction is always irreducible.

In this talk we shall state and prove our zig-zag conjecture which deals
with large exceptional weights and half-integral slopes. These weights
fall squarely outside the scope of the above conjecture. The conjecture
states that the reduction in these cases is given by an alternating
sequence of irreducible and reducible representations depending on the
size of two auxiliary parameters. Special cases of zig-zag have been
proved over the years by various authors using Langlands correspondences.

The present general proof uses the reverse of a recent limiting argument
due to Chitrao-Ghate-Yasuda in the Colmez-Chenevier rigid analytic blow up
space of trianguline representations to reduce the study of the reduction
of crystalline representations to results on the reductions of semi-stable
representations due to Breuil-Mezard, Guerberoff-Park and most recently
Chitrao-Ghate.
