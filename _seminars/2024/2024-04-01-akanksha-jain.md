In this talk, we discuss various aspects of weighted kernel functions on planar domains. We focus on two key kernels, namely,
the weighted Bergman kernel and the weighted Szegő kernel.

For a planar domain $D \subset \mathbb C$ and an admissible weight function on it, we discuss some aspects of the
corresponding weighted Bergman kernel. First, we see a precise relation between the weighted Bergman kernel and the classical
Bergman kernel near a smooth boundary point of the domain. Second, the weighted kernel gives rise to weighted metrics in the
same way as the classical Bergman kernel does. Motivated by work of Mok, Ng, Chan--Yuan and Chan--Xiao--Yuan among others,
we talk about the nature of holomorphic isometries from the unit disc with respect to the weighted Bergman metrics arising from
weights of the form $K(z,z)^{-d}$, where $K$ denotes the classical Bergman kernel and $d$ is a non-negative integer. Specific
examples that we discuss in detail include those in which the isometry takes values in polydisk or a cartesian product of a disc
and a unit ball, where each factor admits a weighted Bergman metric as above for possibly different non-negative integers $d$.
Finally, we also present the case of isometries between polydisks in possibly different dimensions, in which each
factor has a different weighted Bergman metric as above.

In the next part of the talk, we discuss properties of weighted Szegő and Garabedian kernels on planar domains. Motivated by
the unweighted case as explained in Bell's work, the starting point is a weighted Kerzman--Stein formula that yields boundary
smoothness of the weighted Szegő kernel. This provides information on the dependence of the weighted Szegő kernel as a
function of the weight. When the weights are close to the constant function $1$ (which corresponds to the unweighted case), we
show that some properties of the unweighted Szegő kernel propagate to the weighted Szegő kernel as well. Finally, we show
that the reduced Bergman kernel and higher order reduced Bergman kernels can be written as a rational combination of three
unweighted Szegő kernels and their conjugates, thereby extending Bell's list of kernel functions that are made up of simpler
building blocks that involve the Szegő kernel.
