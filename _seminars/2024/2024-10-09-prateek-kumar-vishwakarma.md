We show that the partial sums of the long Pl&uuml;cker relations for
pairs of weakly separated Pl&uuml;cker coordinates oscillate around 0 on
the totally nonnegative part of the Grassmannian. Our result generalizes
the classical oscillating inequalities by Gantmacher&ndash;Krein (1941)
and recent results on totally nonnegative matrix inequalities by
Fallat&ndash;Vishwakarma (2024). In fact we obtain a characterization of
weak separability, by showing that no other pair of Pl&uuml;cker
coordinates satisfies this property.

Weakly separated sets were initially introduced by Leclerc and Zelevinsky
and are closely connected with the cluster algebra of the Grassmannian.
Moreover, our work connects several fundamental objects such as weak
separability, Temperley&ndash;Lieb immanants, and Pl&uuml;cker relations,
and provides a very general and natural class of additive determinantal
inequalities on the totally nonnegative part of the Grassmannian. This is
joint work with Daniel Soskin.
