The classical theory of Toeplitz Operators on Hardy Space over the unit disk is a well-developed area in Operator Theory.
If we substitute the domain disk $\Delta$ with a bounded multiply connected domain $D$, where $\partial D$ consists of
finitely many smooth closed curves, what kinds of difficulties arise? This question motivates us to explore the Theory for
Toeplitz Operators on Hardy Space over multiply connected domains $D$. In 1974, M.B. Abrahamse's Ph.D. thesis made significant
contributions in this topic, extending well-known results for the disk like characterizations of commutator ideals for the
Banach Algebra generated by Toeplitz operators with continuous $\mathbb{C}(\partial D)$ or $H^{\infty+C}(\partial D)$ symbols,
and the characterization of Fredholm operators with $H^{\infty+C}$ symbols to those for the multiply connected domain $D$. Also,
he came up with a striking reduction theorem, which roughly says that modulo compact operators, the Toeplitz operator defined on
the Hardy space over a multiply connected domain $D$, can be written as the direct sum of Toeplitz operators defined on the Hardy
space over the unit disk.

In this talk, we will provide the definition of the Hardy Space $H^p$ over multiple connected domains $D$, where $1 \leq p \leq \infty$,
and build some prerequisites to present the aforementioned characterization theorems obtained by Abrahamse for the case of multiple
connected domains $D$. We will present the proofs of some of these theorems originally done by Abrahamse. Following that, we will
examine the proof of the reduction theorem and explore some of its applications.
