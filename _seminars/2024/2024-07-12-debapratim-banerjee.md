In this talk, we give a new combinatorial proof of classical edge
universality of Wigner matrices without assuming the entries of the
matrices are symmetrically distributed around 0. We complete this proof
by giving a new encoding of the Wigner words and a counting strategy
which works for  traces of very high powers of the matrix. In this talk,
we shall introduce the encoding,  describe the class of words which
capture the randomness and finally give some insight about the proof for
general non vanishing odd moments.
