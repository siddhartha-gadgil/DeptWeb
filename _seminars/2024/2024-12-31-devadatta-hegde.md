Let `$G$` be a split semisimple group over `$\mathbb{Q}$` and let `$P = N \rtimes M$` be a maximal parabolic subgroup of `$G$` defined over `$\mathbb{Q}$`. The Eisenstein series `$E_P(s, \varphi)$` is an automorphic form on `$G(\mathbb{Q})\G(\mathbb{A})$` built from a square-integrable automorphic form `$\varphi$` on `$M(\mathbb{Q})\M(\mathbb{A})^1$` and depends meromorphically on a complex spectral parameter `$s \in \mathbb{C}$`. The poles of these Eisenstein series in the region `$\text{Re}(s) > 0$` play a central role in the spectral decomposition of automorphic forms.
In the 1960s, Langlands showed that when `$\varphi$` is a cuspform, the poles of `$E_P(s, \varphi)$` are determined via `$L$`-functions attached to `$\varphi$` using
the adjoint representation of `$\hat{M}$` on `$\text{Lie}(\hat{N})$`, where `$\hat{cdot}$` stands for the Langlands dual group. No such structural result was known about the poles of `$E_P(s, \varphi)$` when `$\varphi$` is not a cuspform.
It has been known since the 1980s, at least for several important examples, that there is an Arthur parameter `$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \hat{M}$` attached to a non-cuspidal `$\varphi$` on `$M(\mathbb{Q})\M(\mathbb{A})^1$`. The simplest example is when `$\varphi = 1$`, where the Arthur parameter is the principal homomorphism
`$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \hat{M}$`.
In this talk, we provide evidence that the poles of non-cuspidal Eisenstein series `$E_P(s, \varphi)$` in the region `$\text{Re}(s) > 0$` are related to the highest weights occurring in the decomposition of the `$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$` representation on `$\text{Lie}(\hat{N})$` induced by the corresponding Arthur parameter, by determining the poles of the unramified degenerate Eisenstein series `$E_P(s, \varphi = 1)$` using a straightforward global argument.
