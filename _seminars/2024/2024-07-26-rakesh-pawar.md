I will briefly recall Milnor cycle modules over a field as defined by Rost (1996) and their significance and properties. Recently, 'modules' over Milnor–Witt K-theory
or alternatively Milnor–Witt cycle modules over fields have been formalized by N. Feld (2020).

I will talk about recent joint work with Chetan Balwe and Amit Hogadi, where we considered the Milnor–Witt cycle modules over excellent DVR and studied a subclass of
these that satisfy certain lifting conditions on residue maps associated with horizontal valuations. As an important example, Milnor–Witt K-theory of fields belongs
to this subclass. Moreover, this condition is sufficient to deduce the local acyclicity property and $A^1$-homotopy invariance of the associated Gersten complex.
