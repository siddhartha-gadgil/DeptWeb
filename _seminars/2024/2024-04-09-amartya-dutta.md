In the area of Affine Algebraic Geometry, there are several problems on polynomial rings which are easy to state
but difficult to investigate. Late Shreeram S. Abhyankar was the pioneer in investigating a class of such problems
known as Epimorphism Problems or Embedding Problems. In this non-technical survey talk, we shall highlight some of
the contributions of Abhyankar, Moh, Suzuki, Sathaye, Russell, Bhatwadekar and other mathematicians.
