In this talk, we shall study certain aspects of the geometry of the Kobayashi (pseudo)distance and the Kobayashi (pseudo)metric for domains in
$\mathbb{C}^n$. We will focus on the following themes: on the interaction between Kobayashi geometry and the extension of holomorphic mappings,
and on certain negative-curvature-type properties of Kobayashi hyperbolic domains equipped with their Kobayashi distances.

In the initial part of this talk, we shall present a couple of results on local continuous extension of proper holomorphic mappings $F:D \to \Omega$,
$D, \Omega \varsubsetneq \mathbb{C}^n$, making local assumptions on $bD$ and $b\Omega$. These results are motivated by a well-known work by Forstneric--Rosay.
However, our results allow us to have much lower regularity, for the patches of $bD, b\Omega$ that are relevant, than in earlier results in the literature.
Moreover, our assumptions allow $b\Omega$ to contain boundary points of infinite type.

We will also discuss another type of extension phenomenon for holomorphic mappings, namely, Picard-type extension theorems. Well-known works by Kobayashi,
Kiernan, and Joseph--Kwack have showed that Picard-type extension results hold true when the target spaces of the relevant holomorphic mappings belong to
a class of Kobayashi hyperbolic complex manifolds -- viewed as complex submanifolds embedded in some ambient complex manifold -- with certain analytical
properties. Beyond some classical examples, identifying such a target manifold by its geometric properties is, in general, hard. Restricting to $\mathbb{C}^n$
as the ambient space, we provide some geometric conditions on $b\Omega$, for any unbounded domain $\Omega \varsubsetneq \mathbb{C}^n$, for a Picard-type
extension to hold true for holomorphic mappings into $\Omega$. These conditions are suggested, in part, by an explicit lower bound for the Kobayashi metric
of a certain class of bounded domains. We establish the latter estimates using the regularity theory for the complex Monge--Ampere equation. The notion
that allows us to connect these estimates with Picard-type extension theorems is called "visibility".

In the concluding part of this talk, we will explore the notion of visibility for its own sake. For a Kobayashi hyperbolic domain $\Omega \varsubsetneq \mathbb{C}^n$,
$\Omega$ being a visibility domain is a notion of negative curvature of $\Omega$ as a metric space equipped with the Kobayashi distance $K_{\Omega}$ and encodes a
specific way in which $(\Omega, K_{\Omega})$ resembles the Poincare disc model of the hyperbolic plane. The earliest examples of visibility domains, given by
Bharali--Zimmer, are pseudoconvex. In fact, all examples of visibility domains in the literature are, or are conjectured to be, pseudoconvex. We show that there
exist non-pseudoconvex visibility domains. We supplement this proof by a general method to construct a wide range of non-pseudoconvex, hence non-Kobayashi-complete,
visibility domains.
