Finite Ramsey theory is the study of structure that becomes unavoidable in large finite objects. In this talk, we will provide a brief taste
of this rich and beautiful subject. We will start with the following question: In any group of six people, can we always find three who know
one another or three who don't? A far-reaching generalization of this question was first answered in a paper on logic by Frank Ramsey in 1928.
Our approach to it will involve graph theory and combinatorics, with a dash of probability. No prerequisites will be needed to understand the talk.
