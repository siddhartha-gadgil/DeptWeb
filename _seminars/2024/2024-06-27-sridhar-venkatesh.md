Let $f:Y \to X$ be a log resolution of singularities which is an
isomorphism over the smooth locus of $X$, and the exceptional locus $E$
is a simple normal crossing divisor on $Y$. We prove vanishing (and
non-vanishing) results for the higher direct images of differentials on
$Y$ with log poles along $E$ in the case when $X$ is a toric variety. Our
consideration of these sheaves is motivated by the notion of $k$-rational
singularities introduced by Friedman-Laza. This is joint work with Anh
Duc Vo and Wanchun Shen.
