Here the proof that a positive (but not necessarily strictly positive) trigonometric polynomial with matrix coefficients can be written as a finite sum
of hermitian squares of analytic polynomials is sketched. The difficulties in the case of such polynomials with coefficients which are operators on an
infinite dimensional Hilbert space is also briefly discussed.
