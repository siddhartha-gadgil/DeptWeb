We study the ruin probability of a gambler in a scheme where the bet size is doubled after every win in a round and halved after every loss;
we show some paradoxical results such as that the ruin probability is one if and only if the probability of winning in any round is at least half.
We also verify some conjectures about the behaviour of the ruin probability as a function of the initial fortune and the probability of winning.
