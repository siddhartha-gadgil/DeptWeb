Monge-Ampere-positivity (MA-positivity) is a notion of positivity which arises naturally in the study of a generalization the complex 
Monge-Ampere equation to vector bundles. In particular, preservation of MA-positivity along a continuity path turns out to be crucial in 
proving the existence of solutions to the vector bundle Monge-Ampere (vbMA) equation. In this talk, we briefly introduce the vbMA equation
and discuss some recent results such as the preservation of MA-positivity for rank-two holomorphic bundles over complex surfaces and 
the existence of counterexamples to an algebraic version of MA-positivity preservation for vector bundles of rank-three and higher over 
complex manifolds of dimension greater than one.
