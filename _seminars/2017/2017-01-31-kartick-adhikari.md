title: "Hole probabilities for determinantal point processes in the complex plane"
---
Consider the infinite Ginibre ensemble (the distributional limit of
the eigenvalues of nxn random matrices with i.i.d. standard complex
Gaussian entries) in the complex plane. For a bounded set U, let $H_r(U)$ denote
the probability (hole probability) that no points of infinite Ginibre ensemble
fall in the region $rU$. We study the asymptotic
behavior of $H_r(U)$ as $r \to \infty$. Under certain conditions on $U$
we show that $\log H_r(U)=C_U \cdot r^4 (1+o(1))$ as $r \to \infty$. Using
potential theory, we give an explicit formula for $C_U$ in terms of the
minimum logarithmic energy of the set with a quadratic external field. We
calculate $C_U$ explicitly for some special sets such as the annulus, cardioid,
ellipse, equilateral triangle and half disk.

Moreover, we generalize the above hole probability results for a class of
determinantal point processes in the complex plane.
