title: "Theoretical models for compressible vortex streets"
---
Vortex streets are a common feature of fluid flows at high
Reynolds numbers and their study is now well developed for incompressible
fluids. Much less is known, however, about compressible vortex streets. A
fundamental reason appears to be the inapplicability of the point vortex
model to compressible flows. In this talk, we discuss point vortices in the
context of weakly compressible flows and elaborate on the problems
involved. We then adopt the hollow vortex model where each vortex is
modelled as a finite-area constant pressure region with non-zero
circulation. For weakly compressible flows steady hollow vortex solutions
are well known to be candidates for the leading order solution in a
perturbative Rayleigh-Jansen expansion of a compressible flow. Here we give
details of that expansion based on the vortex street solutions of Crowdy &
Green (2012). Physical properties of the compressible vortex streets are
described. Our approach uses the Imai-Lamla method coupled with analytic
function theory and conformal mapping. (Joint work with Darren Crowdy)
