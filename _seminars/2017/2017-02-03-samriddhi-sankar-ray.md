Understanding the origins of intermittency in turbulence
remains one of the most
fundamental challenges in applied mathematics. In recent years there has
been a fresh
attempt to understand this problem through the development of the method
of Fourier
decimation. In this talk, we will review these recent results and analyse
the role of precise
numerical simulations in understanding the mathematics of the
Navier-Stokes and Euler
equations.
