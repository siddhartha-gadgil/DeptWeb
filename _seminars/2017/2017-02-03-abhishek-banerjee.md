title: "What is finiteness?"
series: "Eigenfunctions Seminar"
---
It is generally well known that there is an innate notion of
things like isomorphisms
or epimorphisms. This allows us to talk about isomorphisms or epimorphisms
of various
objects: groups, rings, algebras,etc. In other words, "isomorphism" is
really a categorical
notion.However, it is not so well known that finiteness itself is
alsocategorical. In this talk, we
will discuss how finiteness applies tovarious categories. This will allow
usto see finite sets,
finite dimensional vector spaces, finitely generated algebras and compact
sets as
manifestations of the same basic idea.
