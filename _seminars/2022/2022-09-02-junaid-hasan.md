This talk is based on the work of Stark and Terras (Zeta functions of Finite graphs and
Coverings I, II, III). In this talk we start with an introduction to zeta functions in
various branches of mathematics. Our focus is mainly on zeta functions on finite undirected
connected graphs. We obtain an analogue of the prime number theorem, but for graphs, using
the Ihara Zeta Function. We also introduce edge and path zeta functions and show interesting
results.
