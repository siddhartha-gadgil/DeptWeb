For commuting contractions $T_1,\ldots ,T_n$ acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with
$T=\prod_{i=1}^{n}T_i$, we find a necessary and sufficient condition under which
$(T_1,\ldots ,T_n)$ dilates to commuting isometries $(V_1,\ldots ,V_n)$ or commuting
unitaries $(U_1,\ldots ,U_n)$ acting on the minimal isometric dilation space or the minimal
unitary dilation space of $T$ respectively, where $V=\prod_{i=1}^{n}V_i$ and
$U=\prod_{i=1}^{n}U_i$ are the minimal isometric and the minimal unitary dilations of $T$
respectively. We construct both Sch&auml;ffer and Sz. Nagy-Foias type isometric and unitary
dilations for $(T_1,\ldots ,T_n)$. Also, a special minimal isometric dilation is constructed
where the product $T$ is a $C_0$ contraction, that is $T^{\*n}\to 0$ strongly as $n\to \infty$.
As a consequence of these dilation theorems we obtain different functional models for $(T_1,\ldots ,T_n)$.
When the product $T$ is a $C\_0$ contraction, the dilation of $(T_1,\ldots ,T_n)$ leads to a natural
factorization of $T$ in terms of compression of Toeplitz operators with linear analytic symbols.
