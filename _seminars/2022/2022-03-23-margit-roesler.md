In the analysis on symmetric cones and the classical theory of hypergeometric
functions of matrix argument, the Laplace transform plays an essential role.
In an unpublished manuscript dating back to the 1980ies, I.G. Macdonald proposed
a generalization of this theory, where the spherical polynomials of the
underlying symmetric cone  - such as the cone of positive definite matrices -
are replaced by Jack polynomials with arbitrary index. He also introduced a
Laplace transform in this context, but many of the statements in his manuscript
remained conjectural. In the late 1990ies, Baker and Forrester took up these
matters in their study of Calogero-Moser models, still at a rather formal level, 
and they noticed that they were closely related to Dunkl theory.

In this talk, we explain how Macdonald’s Laplace transform can be rigorously
established within Dunkl theory, and we discuss several of its applications,
including Riesz distributions and Laplace transform identities for the Cherednik
kernel and for Macdonald's hypergeometric series in terms of Jack polynomials. 

Part of the talk is based on joint work with Dominik Brennecken.
