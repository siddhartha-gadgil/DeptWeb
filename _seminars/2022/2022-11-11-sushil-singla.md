Marc Rieffel had introduced the notion of quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance on compact quantum metric spaces
and found a sequence of matrix algebras that converges to the space of continuous functions of two sphere in
this distance, that one finds in many scattered places in the theoretical physics literature. The compact
quantum metric spaces and convergence in the quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance has been explored by a lot of
mathematicians in the last two decades. We will define compact quantum metric space structure on the sequence
of Toeplitz algebras on generalized Bergman space and prove that it converges to the space of continuous
function on odd spheres in the quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This is a joint work with Prof. Tirthankar
Bhattacharyya.
