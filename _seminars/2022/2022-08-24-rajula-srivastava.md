 In this talk, we discuss the problem of obtaining sharp $L^p\to L^q$ estimates for the local
 maximal operator associated with averaging over dilates of the Koranyi sphere on Heisenberg
 groups. This is a codimension one surface compatible with the non-isotropic Heisenberg dilation
 structure. I will describe the main features of the problem, some of which are helpful while
 others are obstructive. These include the non-Euclidean group structure (the extra "twist"
 due to the Heisenberg group law), the geometry of the Koranyi sphere (in particular, the
 flatness at the poles) and an "imbalanced" scaling argument encapsulated by a new type of
 Knapp example, which we shall describe in detail.
