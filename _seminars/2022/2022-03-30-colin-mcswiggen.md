A fundamental and widely used mathematical fact states that the arithmetic mean
of a collection of non-negative real numbers is at least as large as its geometric
mean.  This is the most basic example of a large family of inequalities between
symmetric functions that have attracted the interest of combinatorialists in recent
years.  This talk will present recent joint work with Jon Novak at UC San Diego,
which unifies many such inequalities as corollaries of a fundamental monotonicity
property of spherical functions on symmetric spaces.  We will also discuss conjectural
extensions of these results to even more general objects such as Heckman-Opdam
hypergeometric functions and Macdonald polynomials.

The talk will be accessible to a broad mathematical audience and will not assume
any knowledge of symmetric spaces or symmetric functions.  However, the second half
of the talk will assume familiarity with basic constructions of Lie theory, such
as root systems and the Iwasawa decomposition.  Details of the relevant work can be
found in [this pre-print](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08541.pdf).
