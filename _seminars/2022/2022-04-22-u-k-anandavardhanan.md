Given a group `$G$` and two Gelfand subgroups `$H$` and `$K$` of `$G$`, associated to an irreducible representation `$\pi$` of `$G$`, there is a notion of `$H$` and `$K$` being correlated with respect to `$\pi$` in `$G$`. This notion is defined by Benedict Gross in 1991. We discuss this theme and give some details in a specific example (which is joint work with Arindam Jana).
