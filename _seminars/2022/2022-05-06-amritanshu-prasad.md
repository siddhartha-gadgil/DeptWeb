Let $T$ be a linear endomorphism of a $2m$-dimensional vector space. An
$m$-dimensional subspace $W$ is said to be $T$-splitting if $W$ intersects
$TW$ trivially.

When the underlying field is finite of order $q$ and $T$ is diagonal with
distinct eigenvalues, the number of splitting subspaces is essentially the
the generating function of chord diagrams weighted by their number of
crossings with variable $q$. This generating function was studied by
Touchard in the context of the stamp folding problem. Touchard obtained a
compact form for this generating function, which was explained more
clearly by Riordan.

We provide a formula for the number of splitting subspaces for a general
operator $T$ in terms of the number of $T$-invariant subspaces of various
dimensions. Specializing to diagonal matrices with distinct eigenvalues
gives an unexpected and new proof of the Touchard&ndash;Riordan formula.

This is based on joint work with Samrith Ram.
