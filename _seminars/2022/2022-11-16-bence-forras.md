We introduce a smoothed version of the equivariant `$S$`-truncated
`$p$`-adic Artin `$L$`-function for one-dimensional admissible `$p$`-adic Lie
extensions of number fields. Integrality of this smoothed `$p$`-adic
`$L$`-function, conjectured by Greenberg, has been verified for pro-`$p$`
extensions (assuming the Equivariant Iwasawa Main Conjecture) as well as
`$p$`-abelian extensions (unconditionally). Integrality in the general case
is also expected to hold, and is the subject of ongoing research.
