We prove existence of twisted Kähler-Einstein metrics in big cohomology classes, using a divisorial stability condition. 
In particular, when -K_X is big, we obtain a uniform Yau-Tian-Donaldson existence theorem for Kähler-Einstein metrics. 
To achieve this, we build up from scratch the theory of Fujita-Odaka type delta invariants in the transcendental big setting, 
using pluripotential theory. This is joint work with Kewei Zhang.
