Let `$F$` be a global field and `$\Gamma_F$` its absolute Galois group. Given
a continuous representation `$\bar{\rho}: \Gamma_F \to G(k)$`, where `$G$` is a split
reductive group and `$k$` is a finite field, it is of interest to know when `$\bar{\rho}$` lifts
to a representation `$\rho: \Gamma_F \to G(O)$`, where `$O$` is a complete discrete
valuation ring of characteristic zero with residue field `$k$`. One would also like to control
the local behaviour of `$\rho$` at places of `$F$`, especially at primes dividing `$p = \mathrm{char}(k)$`
(if `$F$` is a number field). In this talk I will give an overview of a method developed in joint work with
Chandrashekhar Khare  and Stefan Patrikis which allows one to construct such lifts in many cases.
