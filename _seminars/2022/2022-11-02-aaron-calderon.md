In her thesis, Maryam Mirzakhani counted the number of simple closed geodesics of bounded length on a (real) hyperbolic surface. 
This breakthrough theorem and the subsequent explosion of related results use techniques and draw inspiration from Teichmüller theory, 
symplectic geometry, surface topology, and homogeneous dynamics. In this talk, I’ll discuss some of these connections as well as a 
qualitative strengthening of her theorem that describes what these curves (and their complements) actually look like. This is joint work 
with Francisco Arana-Herrera.
