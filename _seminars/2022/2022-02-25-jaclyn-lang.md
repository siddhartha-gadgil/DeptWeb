In his 1976 proof of the converse to Herbrand’s theorem, Ribet used Eisenstein-cuspidal congruences to produce unramified degree-`$p$` extensions of the `$p$`-th cyclotomic field when `$p$` is an odd prime.  After reviewing Ribet’s strategy, we will discuss recent work with Preston Wake in which we apply similar techniques to produce unramified degree-`$p$` extensions of `$\mathbb{Q}(N^{1/p})$` when `$N$` is a prime that is congruent to `$-1$` mod `$p$`.  This answers a question posted on Frank Calegari’s blog.
