The (`$p^{\infty}$`) fine Selmer group (also called the `$0$`-Selmer group) of an elliptic curve is a subgroup of the usual `$p^{\infty}$` Selmer group of an elliptic curve and is related to the first and the second Iwasawa cohomology groups. Coates-Sujatha observed that the structure of the fine Selmer group over the cyclotomic `$\mathbb{Z}_p$`-extension of a number field `$K$` is intricately related to Iwasawa's `$\mu$`-invariant vanishing conjecture on the growth of `$p$`-part of the ideal class group of `$K$` in the cyclotomic tower. In this talk, we will discuss the structure and properties of the fine Selmer group over certain `$p$`-adic Lie extensions of global fields. This talk is based on joint work with  Sohan Ghosh and Sudhanshu Shekhar.
