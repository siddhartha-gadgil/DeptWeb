In this talk, we will explain the existence of a universal braided compact quantum group acting
on a graph $C^\*$-algebra in the twisted monoidal category of $C^\*$-algebras equipped with an action
of the circle group. To achieve this we construct a braided version of the free unitary quantum
group. Finally, we will compute this universal braided compact quantum group for the Cuntz algebra.
This is a joint work in progress with Suvrajit Bhattacharjee and Soumalya Joardar.
