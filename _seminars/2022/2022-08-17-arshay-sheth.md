Euler systems are cohomological tools that play a crucial role in the study of special values of `$L$`-functions; for instance, they have been used to prove cases of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and have recently been used to prove cases of the more general Bloch--Kato conjecture. A fundamental technique in these recent advances is to show that Euler systems vary in `$p$`-adic families. In this talk, we will first give a general introduction to the theme of `$p$`-adic variation in number theory and introduce the necessary background from the theory of Euler systems; we will then explain the idea and importance of `$p$`-adically varying Euler systems, and finally discuss current work in progress on `$p$`-adically varying the Asai--Flach Euler system, which is an Euler system arising from quadratic Hilbert modular eigenforms.
