We construct a pointwise Boutet de Monvel-Sjostrand parametrix for the Szegő kernel of a weakly pseudoconvex
three dimensional CR manifold of finite type assuming the range of its tangential CR operator to be closed;
thereby extending the earlier analysis of Christ. This particularly extends Fefferman's boundary asymptotics
of the Bergman kernel to weakly pseudo-convex domains in dimension two. Next we present an application where
we prove that a weakly pseudoconvex two dimensional domain of finite type with a Kähler-Einstein Bergman metric
is biholomorphic to the unit ball. This extends earlier work of Fu-Wong and Nemirovski-Shafikov. Based on joint
works with C.Y. Hsiao and M. Xiao.
