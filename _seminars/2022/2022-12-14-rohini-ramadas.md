$\mathrm{Per}\_n $ is an affine algebraic curve, defined over $\mathbb Q$,
parametrizing (up to change of coordinates) degree-2 self-morphisms of
$\mathbb P^1$ with an $n$-periodic ramification point. The $n$-th Gleason
polynomial $G_n$ is a polynomial in one variable with $\mathbb
Z$-coefficients, whose vanishing locus parametrizes (up to change of
coordinates) degree-2 self-morphisms of $\mathbb C$ with an
$n$-periodic ramification point. Two long-standing open questions in
complex dynamics are: (1) Is $\mathrm{Per}\_n$ connected? (2) Is $G_n$
irreducible over $\mathbb Q$?

We show that if $G_n$ is irreducible over $\mathbb Q$, then
$\mathrm{Per}\_n$ is irreducible over $\mathbb C$, and is therefore
connected. In order to do this, we find a $\mathbb Q$-rational smooth
point of a projective completion of $\mathrm{Per}\_n$. This $\mathbb
Q$-rational smooth point represents a special degeneration of degree-2
morphisms, and as such admits an interpretation in terms of tropical
geometry.

(This talk will be pitched at a broad audience.)
