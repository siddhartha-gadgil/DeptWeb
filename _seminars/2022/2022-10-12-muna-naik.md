This talk will be a continuation of my [previous talk](http://www.math.iisc.ac.in/seminars/2022/2022-09-14-muna-naik.html).
In this talk, I will present the proof of a result stated in my earlier talk, which characterizes eigenfunctions of the
Laplace--Beltrami operator through sphere averages as the radius of the sphere tends to infinity in a rank one symmetric
space of noncompact type.

The [video of this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qKalGGx7es&list=PLQXtaLhI1-1qxOEykh-1WOFkYuIzEE-ev) is available
