This talk is motivated by interest in Crouzeix's conjecture for compressions
of the shift with finite Blaschke products as symbols. Specifically, in this
setting, Crouzeix’s conjecture suggests a related, weaker conjecture about
the behavior of level sets of finite Blaschke products. I’ll discuss this
level set conjecture in several cases, though the main case of interest will
involve uncritical finite Blaschke products. Here, the geometry of the numerical
ranges of their associated compressions of the shift has allowed us to establish
the conjecture in low degree situations (n=3, n=4, n =5 with a caveat). Time
permitting, I’ll explain how these geometric results also give insights into
Crouzeix's conjecture for the associated compressed shifts. This talk is based
on joint work with Pam Gorkin.
