Let $D\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ be a bounded, strongly pseudoconvex domain
whose boundary $bD$ satisfies the minimal regularity condition of class
$C^2$.  A 2017 result of Lanzani & E. M. Stein states that the
Cauchy--Szeg&ouml; projection $\mathcal{S}\_\omega$ maps $L^p(bD, \omega)$ to
$L^p(bD, \omega)$ continuously for any $1<p<\infty$ whenever the
reference measure $\omega$ is a bounded, positive continuous multiple of
induced Lebesgue measure. Here we show that $\mathcal{S}\_\omega$ (defined with
respect to any measure $\omega$ as above) satisfies explicit, optimal
bounds in $L^p(bD, \Omega_p)$, for any $1<p<\infty$ and for any $\Omega_p$
in the maximal class of $A_p$-measures, that is $\Omega_p =
\psi_p\sigma$ where  $\psi_p$ is a Muckenhoupt $A_p$-weight and $\sigma$
is the induced Lebesgue measure. As an application, we characterize
boundedness in $L^p(bD, \Omega_p)$ with explicit bounds, and compactness,
of the commutator $\[b, \mathcal{S}\_\omega\]$ for any $A_p$-measure $\Omega_p$,
$1<p<\infty$. We next introduce the notion of holomorphic Hardy spaces
for $A_p$-measures, and we characterize boundedness and compactness  in
$L^2(bD, \Omega_2)$ of the commutator $\[b,\mathcal{S}\_{\Omega_2}\]$
where $\mathcal{S}\_{\Omega_2}$ is the Cauchy--Szeg&ouml; projection defined with
respect to any given $A_2$-measure $\Omega_2$. Earlier results rely upon
an asymptotic expansion and subsequent pointwise estimates of the
Cauchy--Szeg&ouml; kernel, but these are unavailable in our setting of
minimal regularity of $bD$; at the same time, recent techniques that
allow to handle domains with minimal regularity, are not applicable to
$A_p$-measures. It turns out that the method of quantitative
extrapolation is an appropriate replacement for the missing tools.
