Given a bipartite graph $G$ (subject to a constraint), the "cross-ratio
degree" of G is a non-negative integer invariant of $G$, defined via a
simple counting problem in algebraic geometry. I will discuss some
natural contexts in which cross-ratio degrees arise. I will then present
a perhaps-surprising upper bound on cross-ratio degrees in terms of
counting perfect matchings. Finally, time permitting, I may discuss the
tropical side of the story.
