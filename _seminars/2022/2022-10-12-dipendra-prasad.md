If `$\theta$` is an involution on a group `$G$` with fixed points `$H$`, 
it is a question of considerable interest to classify irreducible representations of `$G$` 
which carry an `$H$`-invariant linear form.  We will discuss some cases of this 
question paying attention to finite dimensional representation of compact groups
where it is called the Cartan-Helgason theorem.
