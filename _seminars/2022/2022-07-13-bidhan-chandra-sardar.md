In this talk, we consider the optimal control problem (OCP) governed by the steady Stokes system in a
two-dimensional domain $\Omega_{\epsilon}$ with a rapidly oscillating boundary prescribed with Neumann
boundary condition and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the rest of the boundary. We aim to study the
convergences analysis of the optimal solution (as $\epsilon\to 0$) and identify the limit OCP problem
in a fixed domain.
