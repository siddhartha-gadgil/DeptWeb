Hilbert modular forms are generalization of classical modular forms over totally real number fields. The Fourier coefficients of a modular form are of great importance owing to
their rich arithmetic and algebraic properties. In the theory of modular forms one of the
classical problems is to determine a modular form by a subset of all Fourier coefficient.
In this talk, we discuss about to determination of a Hilbert modular form by the Fourier
coefficients indexed by square-free integral ideals. In particular, we talk about the following result.

Given any `$\epsilon>0$`, a non zero Hilbert cusp form `$\mathbf{f}$`  of weight `$k=(k_1,k_2,\ldots, k_n)\in (\mathbb{Z}^{+})^n$` and square-free level `$\mathfrak{n}$` with Fourier coefficients 
`$C(\mathbf{f},\mathfrak{m})$`, then there exists a square-free integral ideal `$\mathfrak{m}$` with `$N(\mathfrak{m})\ll k_0^{3n+\epsilon} N(\mathfrak{m})^{\frac{6n^2 +1}{2}+\epsilon}$` such that `$C(\mathbf{f},\mathfrak{m})\neq 0$`. The implied constant depend on `$\epsilon , F.$`
