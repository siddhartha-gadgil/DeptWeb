Let `$k$` be a nonarchimedian local field, `$\widetilde{G}$` a connected reductive `$k$`-group, `$\Gamma$` a finite group of automorphisms of `$\widetilde{G}$,` and `$G:= (\widetilde{G}^\Gamma)^\circ$` the connected part
of the group of `$\Gamma$`-fixed points of `$\widetilde{G}$`.
The first half of my talk will concern motivation: a desire for a more explicit understanding of base change and other liftings of representations.  Toward this end, we adapt some results of Kaletha-Prasad-Yu.  Namely, if one assumes that the residual characteristic of `$k$` does not divide the order of `$\Gamma$`, then they show, roughly speaking, that `$G$` is reductive, the building `$\mathcal{B}(G)$` of `$G$` embeds in the set of `$\Gamma$`-fixed points of `$\mathcal{B}(\widetilde{G})$`, and similarly for reductive quotients of parahoric subgroups.

We prove similar statements, but under a different hypothesis on `$\Gamma$`. Our hypothesis does not imply that of K-P-Y, nor vice versa. I will include some comments on how to resolve such a totally unacceptable situation.
