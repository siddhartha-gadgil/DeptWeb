We shall discuss Legendre Pairs, an interesting combinatorial object related to the
Hadamard conjecture. We shall demonstrate the exceptional versatility of Legendre Pairs,
as they admit several different formulations via concepts from disparate areas of
Mathematics and Computer Science. We shall mention old and new results and conjectures
within the past 20+ years, as well as potential future avenues for investigation.
