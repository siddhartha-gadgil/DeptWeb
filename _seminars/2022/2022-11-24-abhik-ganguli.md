Let `$F$` be a totally real field and `$p$` be an odd prime unramified in `$F$`. We will give an overview of the problem of determining the explicit mod `$p$` structure of a modular `$p$`-adic Galois representation and determining the associated local Serre weights. The Galois representations are attached to Hilbert modular forms over `$F$`, more precisely to eigenforms on a Shimura curve over `$F$`. The weight part of the Serre's modularity conjecture for Hilbert modular forms relates the local Serre weights at a place `$v|p$` to the structure of the mod `$p$` Galois representation at the inertia group over `$v$`. Thus, local Serre weights give good information on the structure of the modular mod `$p$` Galois representation. The eigenforms considered are of small slope at a fixed place `$\mathbf{p}|p$`, and with certain constraints on the weight over `$\mathbf{p}$`. This is based on a joint work with Shalini Bhattacharya.
