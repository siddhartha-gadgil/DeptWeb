There many operators in Harmonic Analysis which can be described as an average
of a family of operators $\\{T_j\\}\_j$ for which some boundedness properties
are known. In particular, if $T_j$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p$, then the
Minkowski integral inequality tells us that $T$ also satisfies this property.
But things change completely if the information that we have is that $T_j$
are of weak type (1,1).

However, under certain condition on the operators $T_j$,
the weak type boundedness of $T$ can be reached. 

This is a joint work with my student Sergi Baena.
