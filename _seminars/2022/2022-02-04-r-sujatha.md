Let `$R$` be the Iwasawa algebra over a compact, `$p$`-adic, pro-`$p$` group
`$G$`, where `$G$` arises as a Galois group of number fields from Galois representations.
Suppose `$M$` is a finitely generated `$R$`-module. In the late 1970’s , Harris studied the 
asymptotic growth of the ranks of certain coinvariants of `$M$` arising from the action 
of open subgroups of `$G$` and related them to the codimension of `$M$`. In this talk, we 
explain how Harris’ proofs can be simplified and improved upon, with possible
applications to studying some natural subquotients of the Galois groups of number fields.
