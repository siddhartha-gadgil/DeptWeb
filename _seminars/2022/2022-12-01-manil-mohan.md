We discuss the random dynamics and asymptotic analysis of 2D Navier–Stokes equations. We consider two-dimensional
stochastic Navier-Stokes equations (SNSE) driven by a linear multiplicative white noise of Ito type on the whole space.
We prove that non-autonomous 2D SNSE generates a bi-spatial continuous random cocycle. Due to the bi-spatial continuity
property of the random cocycle associated with SNSE, we show that if the initial data is in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, then
there exists a unique bi-spatial $(L^2(\mathbb{R}^2), \mathbb{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^2))$-pullback random attractor for
non-autonomous SNSE which is compact and attracting not only in $L^2$-norm but also in $\mathbb{H}^1$-norm. Next, we
discuss the existence of an invariant measure for the random cocycle associated with autonomous SNSE which is a
consequence of the existence of random attractors. We prove the uniqueness of invariant measures  by using the
linear multiplicative structure of the noise coefficient and exponential stability of solutions.
