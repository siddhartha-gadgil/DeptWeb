We will present some recent work on the classification of
shrinking gradient Kähler-Ricci solitons on complex surfaces. In
particular, we classify all non-compact examples, which together with
previous work of Tian, Wang, Zhu, and others in the compact case gives
the complete classification. This is joint work with R. Bamler, R.
Conlon, and A. Deruelle.
