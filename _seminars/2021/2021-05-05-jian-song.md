Let K(n, V) be the space of n-dimensional compact Kahler-Einstein manifolds with negative scalar curvature and volume bounded above by V. 
We prove that any sequence in K(n, V) converges in pointed Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a finite union of complete Kahler-Einstein metric spaces without 
loss of volume, which is biholomorphic to an algebraic semi-log canonical model with its non-log terminal locus removed. We further show that the Weil-Petersson 
metric extends uniquely to a Kahler current with continuous local potentials on the KSB compactification of the moduli space of canonically polarized manifolds. 
In particular, the Weil-Petersson volume of the KSB moduli space is finite.
