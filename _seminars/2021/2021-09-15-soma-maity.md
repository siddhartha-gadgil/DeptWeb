Consider a proper geodesic metric space $(X,d)$ equipped with a Borel measure $\mu.$ We establish a family of uniform Poincare inequalities on $(X,d,\mu)$ 
if it satisfies a local Poincare inequality ($P_{loc}$), and a condition on the growth of volume. Consequently, if $\mu$ is doubling and supports $(P_{loc})$ 
then it satisfies a uniform $(\sigma,\beta,\sigma)$-Poincare inequality. If $(X,d,\mu)$ is a Gromov-hyperbolic space, then using the volume comparison theorem 
introduced by Besson, Courtoise, Gallot, and Sambusetti, we obtain a uniform Poincare inequality with the exponential growth of the Poincare constant. 
Next, we relate the growth of Poincare constants to the growth of discrete subgroups of isometries of $X$, which act on it properly. This is Joint work with 
Gautam Nilakantan.
