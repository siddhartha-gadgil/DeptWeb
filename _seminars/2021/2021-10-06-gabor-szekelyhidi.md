Leon Simon showed that if an area minimizing hypersurface
admits a cylindrical tangent cone of the form C x R, then this tangent
cone is unique for a large class of minimal cones C. One of the
hypotheses in this result is that C x R is integrable and this
excludes the case when C is the Simons cone over S^3 x S^3. The main
result in this talk is that the uniqueness of the tangent cone holds
in this case too. The new difficulty in this non-integrable situation
is to develop a version of the Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality that can
be used in the setting of tangent cones with non-isolated
singularities.
