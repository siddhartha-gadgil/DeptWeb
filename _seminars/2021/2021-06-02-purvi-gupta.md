A compact subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$ is polynomially convex if it is defined by a
family of polynomial inequalities. The minimum complex dimension into which all
compact real manifolds of a fixed dimension admit smooth polynomially convex
embeddings is not known (although there are some obvious bounds).

In this talk, we will discuss some recent improvements on the previously known
bounds, especially focusing on the odd-dimensional case, where the embeddings
cannot be produced by classical (local) perturbation techniques. This is joint
work with R. Shafikov.
