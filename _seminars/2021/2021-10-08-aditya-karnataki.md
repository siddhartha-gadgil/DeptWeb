Let `$K$` be a finite extension of `$\mathbb{Q}_p$`. The theory of `$(\varphi, \Gamma)$`-modules constructed by Fontaine provides a good category to study `$p$`-adic representations of the absolute Galois group `$Gal(\bar{K}/K)$`. This theory arises from a ''devissage'' of the extension `$\bar{K}/K$` through an intermediate extension `$K_{\infty}/K$` which is the cyclotomic extension of `$K$`. The notion of `$(\varphi, \tau)$`-modules generalizes Fontaine's constructions by using Kummer extensions other than the cyclotomic one.  It encapsulates the important notion of Breuil-Kisin modules among others. It is thus desirable to establish properties of `$(\varphi, \tau)$`-modules parallel to the cyclotomic case. In this talk, we explain the construction of a functor that associates to a family of `$p$`-adic Galois representations a family of `$(\varphi, \tau)$`-modules. The analogous functor in the `$(\varphi, \Gamma)$`-modules case was constructed by Berger and Colmez . This is joint work with Leo Poyeton.
