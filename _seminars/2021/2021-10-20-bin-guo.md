We will discuss the $L^\infty$ estimates for a class of fully nonlinear partial differential equations on a compact Kahler manifold, which includes the complex 
Monge-Ampere and Hessian equations. Our approach is purely based on PDE methods, and is free of pluripotential theory. We will also talk about some generalizations 
to the stability of MA and Hessian equations. This is based on joint works with D.H. Phong and F. Tong.
