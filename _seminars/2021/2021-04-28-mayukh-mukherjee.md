In this talk, we discuss a basic (and somewhat classical) problem
of Laplace eigenfunction mass concentration on convex polyhedra. We
show quantitative mass concentration in a neighbourhood of the
non-smooth part of the boundary, or the "pockets" of the billiard.
On the way, we discuss several new dynamical properties of the
billiard flow which are required for the proof.
