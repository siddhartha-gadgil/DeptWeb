The k-differentials are sections of the tensorial product of the canonical bundle of a complex algebraic curves. Fixing a partition (m_1,...,m_n) of k(2g-2), 
we can define the strata of k-differentials of type (m_1,...,m_n) to be the space of k-differentials on genus g curves with zeroes of orders m_i. 
After checking that the strata or not empty, the first interesting topological question about these strata is the classification of their connected component. 
In the case k=1, this was settled in an important paper of Kontsevich and Zorich. This result was extend to k=2 by Lanneau, with corrections of Chen-MÃ¶ller. 
The classification is unknown for k greater or equal to 3 as soon as g is greater or equal to 2. In this talk, I will present partial results on this 
classification problem obtained together with Dawei Chen (arXiv:2101.01650) and in progress with Andrei Bogatyrev. In particular, I will highlight the way 
Pell-Abel equation appears in this problem.
