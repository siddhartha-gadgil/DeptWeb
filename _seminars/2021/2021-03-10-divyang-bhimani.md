We consider nonlinear Schrödinger equations in Fourier-Lebesgue
and modulation spaces involving negative regularity. The
equations are posed on the whole space, and involve a smooth power
nonlinearity. We prove two types of norm inflation (strong
ill-posedness) results. We first establish norm inflation results
below the expected critical regularities. We then prove norm
inflation with infinite loss of regularity under less general assumptions.
We shall also discuss similar results for fractional Hartree equation. 
The talk is based on a joint work with Remi Carles and Saikatul Haque.
