Let $X$ be your favorite Banach space of continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Given a real-valued function $f$ defined on some (possibly awful) set $E$
in $\mathbb{R}^n$, how can we decide whether $f$ extends to a function $F$ in $X$?
If such an $F$ exists, then how small can we take its norm? Can we make $F$
depend linearly on $f$? What can we say about the derivatives of $F$ at or
near points of $E$ (assuming $X$ consists of differentiable functions)?

Suppose $E$ is finite. Can we compute a nearly optimal $F$? How many
computer operations does it take? What if we demand merely that $F$
agree approximately with $f$? Suppose we allow ourselves to discard a
few data points as "outliers". Which points should we discard?
