The notion of Heisenberg uniqueness pair has been introduced by Hedenmalm
and Montes-Rodriguez (Ann. of Math. 2011) as a version of the uncertainty
principle, that is, a nonzero function and its Fourier transform both
cannot be too small simultaneously. Let $\Gamma$ be a smooth curve or
finite disjoint union of smooth curves in the plane and $\Lambda$ be any
subset of the plane. Let $\mathcal X(\Gamma)$ be the space of all finite
complex-valued Borel measures in the plane which are supported on
$\Gamma$ and are absolutely continuous with respect to the arc length
measure on $\Gamma.$ Let $\mathcal{AC}(\Gamma,\Lambda)=\\{\mu\in
\mathcal{X}(\Gamma) : \widehat\mu|\_{\Lambda}=0\\},$ then we say that
$\Lambda$ is a _Fourier uniqueness set_ for $\Gamma$ or
$(\Gamma,\Lambda)$ is a Heisenberg uniqueness pair, if
$\mathcal{AC}(\Gamma,\Lambda)=\{0\}.$ 

In this talk, we will discuss the following:  Let $\Gamma$ be the
hyperbola $\\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2 : xy=1\\}$ and $\Lambda_\beta^\theta$ be
the lattice-cross defined by
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_\beta^\theta=\left((\mathbb Z+\\{\theta\\})\times\\{0\\}\right) \cup
\left(\\{0\\}\times\beta\mathbb Z\right),
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is a positive real and $\theta=1/{p}$, for
some $p\in\mathbb N,$ then $\left(\Gamma,\Lambda_\beta^\theta\right)$
is a Heisenberg uniqueness pair if and only if $\beta\leq{p}.$ Moreover,
the space $\mathcal{AC}\left(\Gamma,\Lambda_\beta^\theta\right)$ is
infinite-dimensional provided $\beta>p.$
