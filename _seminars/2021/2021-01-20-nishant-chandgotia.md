Given a finite (complex-valued) measure $\mu$ on the circle
$\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ we write supp(mu-hat) to denote the support
of its Fourier coefficients. A subset $P$ of the integers is called a
Riesz set if for all measures $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ for which
supp$(\widehat{\mu}) \subset P$, $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with
respect to the Lebesgue measure. It is well-known that $P=-\mathbb{N}$,
the negative integers, form a Riesz set given a famous result by
F. and M. Riesz. Rudin proved that if one appends a lacunary set to the
set of negative natural numbers, then it is a Riesz set. This idea was
picked up by Meyer who wrote a beautiful paper on the subject, christened
such sets (as Riesz sets) and proved, for instance, that appending the
squares to the negative integers is still a Riesz set. For this proof a
surprising (only initially though) use of the Bohr topology plays an important role.

Can we do this for the cubes? I believe that this is still open and the
only progress made uses Fermat’s last theorem. I am not a specialist on
the subject and have some rudimentary understanding of harmonic analysis.
Most of what I have learnt is by talking to some specialists and reading
a few papers/text books. Still, I will attempt to give you a primer on
what I know and what I believe nobody does.
