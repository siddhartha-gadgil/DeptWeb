Let `$F$` be a non-archimedean local field of residue characteristic `$p$`. The classical local Langlands correspondence is a 1-1 correspondence between 2-dimensional irreducible complex representations of the Weil group of `$F$` and certain smooth irreducible complex representations of `$GL_2(F)$`. The number-theoretic applications made it necessary to seek such correspondence of representations on vector spaces over a field of characteristic `$p$`. In this talk, however, I will show that for `$F$` of residue degree `$> 1$`, unfortunately, there is no such 1-1 mod `$p$` correspondence. This result is an elaboration of the arguments of Breuil and Paskunas to an arbitrary local field of residue degree `$> 1$`.
