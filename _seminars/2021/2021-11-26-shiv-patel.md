Let `$H$` be a subgroup of a group `$G$`. For an irreducible representation `$\sigma$` of `$H$`, the triple `$(G,H, \sigma)$` is called a Gelfand triple if `$\sigma$` appears at most once in any irreducible representation of `$G$`. Given a triple, it is usually difficult to determine whether a given triple is a Gelfand triple. One has a sufficient condition which is geometric in nature to determine if a given triple is a Gelfand triple, called Gelfand criterion. We will discuss some examples of the Gelfand triple which give us multiplicity one theorem for non-degenerate Whittaker models of `${\mathrm GL}_n$` over finite chain rings, such as `$\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$`. 
This is a joint work with Pooja Singla.
