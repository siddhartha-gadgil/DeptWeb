A countable family $\\{\psi_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\\}$ of elements in a
Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ constitutes a frame if there are constants
$0< A\leq B < \infty$ s.t. $\forall f \in \mathcal{H}$  we have:
\begin{equation}
A\\|f\\|^2 \leq \sum\limits_n|\langle f,\psi_n \rangle|^2\leq B \\|f\\|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$ denotes an inner-product in
$\mathcal{H}$. Frames were introduced by Duffin and Schaeffer in 1952 to
deal with problems in nonharmonic Fourier series, and have been used more
recently to obtain signal reconstruction for signals embedded in certain
noises.

For a given pair of frames $\\{\psi_n\\}$ and $\\{\varphi_n\\}$ in
$\mathcal{H}$, the associated mixed frame operator $S: \mathcal{H} \to
\mathcal{H}; f \mapsto \sum_n \langle f, \psi_n \rangle\varphi_n$ is a
bounded linear operator. The translation invariance of this operator
plays a significant role in investigating reproducing formulas for frame
pairs $\\{\psi_n\\}$ and $\\{\varphi_n\\}$ in $\mathcal{H}$.

In the present talk, we examine necessary and sufficient conditions for
$S$ to be invariant under translations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ when
$\\{\psi_n\\}$ and $\\{\varphi_n\\}$ belong to a special class of structured
frame systems in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
