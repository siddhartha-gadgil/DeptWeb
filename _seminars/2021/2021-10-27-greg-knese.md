We provide detailed local descriptions of stable polynomials in terms of their homogeneous
decompositions, Puiseux expansions, and transfer function realizations. We use this theory to first
prove that bounded rational functions on the polydisk possess non-tangential limits at every
boundary point. We relate higher non-tangential regularity and distinguished boundary behavior
of bounded rational functions to geometric properties of the zero sets of stable polynomials via
our local descriptions. For a fixed stable polynomial $p$, we analyze the ideal of numerators $q$
such that $q/p$ is bounded on the bi-upper half plane. We completely characterize this ideal in
several geometrically interesting situations including smooth points, double points, and ordinary
multiple points of $p$. Finally, we analyze integrability properties of bounded rational functions
and their derivatives on the bidisk.  Joint work with Bickel, Pascoe, Sola.
