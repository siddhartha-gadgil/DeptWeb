Homological stability is an interesting phenomenon exhibited by many natural sequences of classifying spaces and moduli spaces like the moduli spaces of 
curves M_g and the moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian varieties A_g. In this talk  I will explain some efforts to find similar phenomena in 
the cohomology of discrimination complements.
