Let $W$ be a finite reflection group associated with a root system $R$
in $\mathbb R^d$. Let $C_+$ denote a positive Weyl chamber.
Consider an open subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb R^d$, symmetric with
respect to reflections from $W$. Let $\Omega_+=\Omega\cap C_+$ be the
positive
part of $\Omega$. We define a family $\{-\Delta_{\eta}^+\}$ of
self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian $-\Delta_{\Omp}$, labeled by
homomorphisms $\eta\colon W\to \{1,-1\}$. In the construction of these
$\eta$-Laplacians  $\eta$-symmetrization of functions on $\Omega$ is
involved. The Neumann Laplacian
$-\Delta_{N,\Omega_+}$ is included and corresponds to $\eta\equiv1$.
If $H^{1}(\Om)=H^{1}_0(\Om)$, then the Dirichlet Laplacian
$-\Delta_{D,\Omega_+}$ is
either included and corresponds to $\eta={\rm sgn}$; otherwise the
Dirichlet Laplacian is considered separately. Applying  the spectral
functional calculus we consider the pairs of operators
$\Psi(-\Delta_{N,\Omega})$ and $\Psi(-\Delta_{\eta}^+)$, or
$\Psi(-\Delta_{D,\Omega})$ and $\Psi(-\Delta_{D,\Omega_+})$,
where  $\Psi$ is a Borel function on $\[0,\infty)$. We prove relations
between the integral kernels for the operators in these pairs, which
are given in terms of symmetries governed by $W$. 

In the talk, for simplicity, I will focus on the case $\Omega = \R^d$ (so $\Omega_+ = C_+$)
and $\Psi = \Psi_t, t > 0$, where $\Psi_t(\lambda) = exp(−t\lamba)$ for $\lambda > 0$. Then the integral
kernels of $\Psi_t(-Delta^{+}\_{\eta})$, called the $\eta$-heat kernels, will be investigated in more
detail.
