Anosov representations are representations of word hyperbolic groups into semisimple Lie groups with many good geometric properties. In this talk I will 
develop a theory of Anosov representation of geometrically finite Fuchsian groups (a special class of relatively hyperbolic groups). 
I will only discuss the case of representations into the special linear group and avoid general Lie groups. This is joint work with Canary and Zhang.
