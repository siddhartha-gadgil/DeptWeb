The study of projective representations of a group has a long history
starting from the work of Schur. Two essential ingredients to study
the group's projective representations are describing its Schur multiplier
and representation group. In this talk, we describe these for the discrete
Heisenberg groups. We also include a few general results regarding projective
representations of finitely generated discrete nilpotent groups. This talk
is based on the joint work with Sumana Hatui and E.K. Narayanan.
