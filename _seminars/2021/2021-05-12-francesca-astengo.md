A result due to Hulanicki (and refined by Veneruso) states that if $m$ is a
Schwartz function on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $L, T$ are the Heisenberg sublaplacian
and the central derivative, then the operator $m(L,i^{-1}T)$ has a Schwartz
radial convolution kernel $k$. It is therefore natural to ask whether all
Schwartz convolution kernels arise in this way. In collaboration with Bianca
Di Blasio and Fulvio Ricci we are considering this kind of problem in the
context of Gelfand Pairs of polynomial growth. In this talk I will discuss
some old and new results.
