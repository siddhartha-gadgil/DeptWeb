I will discuss some aspects of a singular version of the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem for bundles
and sheaves  over normal complex varieties satisfying some conditions. Several applications follow, such as a 
characterization of the case of equality in the Bogomolov-Gieseker theorem. Such singular metrics also
arise naturally under certain types of degenerations, and I will make some comments on
the relationship between this result and  the Mehta-Ramanathan restriction theorem.
