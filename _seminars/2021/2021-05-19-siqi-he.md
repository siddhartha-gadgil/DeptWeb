The Hitchin-Simpson equations defined over a Kaehler manifold are first order, non-linear equations for a pair of a connection on a Hermitian vector bundle 
and a 1-form with values in the endomorphism bundle. We will describe the behavior of solutions to the Hitchinâ€“Simpson equations with norms of these 1-forms 
unbounded. We will talk about two applications of this compactness theorem, one is the realization problem of the Taubes' Z2 harmonic 1-form and another is the 
Hitchin's WKB problem in higher dimensional. We will also discuss some open questions related to this question.
