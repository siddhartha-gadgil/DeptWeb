In the 1980’s, Greene defined hypergeometric functions over finite fields using
Jacobi sums. The framework of his theory establishes that these functions possess many properties that are analogous to those of the classical hypergeometric
series studied by Gauss, Kummer and others. These functions have played important roles in the study of Apery-style supercongruences, the Eichler-Selberg trace
formula, Galois representations, and zeta-functions of arithmetic varieties. In this
talk we discuss the distributions (over large finite fields) of natural families of these
functions. For the `$_2F_1$` functions, the limiting distribution is semicircular, whereas
the distribution for the `$_3F_2$` functions is Batman distribution.
