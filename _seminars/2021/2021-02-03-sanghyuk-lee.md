This talk primarily concerns the sharp bound on the spectral projection
of the Hermite operator in the $L^p$ spaces. In comparison with the
spectral projection of the Laplacian, the sharp bound has not been not
so well understood.  We consider the estimate for the spectral Hermite
projection in general $L^p-L^q$ framework and obtain various new sharp
estimates in an extended range. Especially, we provide a complete
characterization of the local estimate and prove the endpoint
$L^2$--$L^{2(d+3)/(d+1)}$ estimate which has been left open since the
work of Koch and Tataru.  We also discuss application of the projection
estimate to related problems, such as the resolvent estimate for the
Hermite operator and Carleman estimate for the heat operator.
