We consider a class of oscillatory integrals with polynomial phase functions
$P$ over global domains $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. As an analogue of Varchenko's
theorem in a global domain, we investigate the two main issues
(i) whether the integral converges or not and (ii) how fast it decays.
They are described in terms of a generalized notion of Newton polyhedra
associated with $(P,D)$. Finally, we discuss its applications to the Strichartz
Estimates associated with the general class of dispersive equations.
