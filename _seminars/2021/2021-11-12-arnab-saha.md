The theory of `$\delta$`-geometry was developed by A. Buium based on the analogy with differential algebra where the analogue of a differential operator is played by a `$\pi$`-derivation `$\delta$`. A `$\pi$`-derivation `$\delta$` arises from the `$\pi$`-typical Witt vectors and naturally associates with a lift of Frobenius `$\phi$`. In this talk, we will discuss the theory of `$\delta$`-geometry for Anderson modules. Anderson modules are higher dimensional generalizations of Drinfeld modules.

As an application of the above, we will construct a canonical `$z$`-isocrystal `$\mathbb{H}(E)$` with a Hodge- Pink structure associated to an Anderson module `$E$` defined over a `$\pi$`-adically complete ring `$R$` with a fixed `$\pi$`-derivation `$\delta$` on it. Depending on a `$\delta$`-modular parameter, we show that the `$z$`-isocrystal `$\mathbb{H}(E)$` is weakly admissible in the case of Drinfeld modules of rank `$2$`. Hence, by the analogue of Fontaine's mysterious functor in the positive characteristic case (as constructed by Hartl), one associates a Galois representation to such an `$\mathbb{H}(E)$`. The relation of our construction with the usual Galois representation arising from the Tate module of `$E$` is currently not clear. This is a joint work with Sudip Pandit.
