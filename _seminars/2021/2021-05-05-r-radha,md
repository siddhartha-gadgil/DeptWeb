It is well known that the system of translates $\\{T_k\phi:k\in\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is a
_Riesz_ sequence in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ if and only if there exist $A,B>0$ such that
\begin{equation}
A\leq\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}|\widehat{\phi}(\xi+k)|^2\leq B\hspace{.5 cm}a.e.\ \xi\in[0,1],
\end{equation}
where $\widehat{\phi}$ denotes the _Fourier_ transform of $\phi$. This result is very
important in time-frequency analysis especially in constructing wavelet basis for
$L^2(\mathbb{R})$ using _multiresolution analysis_ technique and also in studying sampling
problems in a shift-invariant space.

In this talk, we ask a similar question for the system of left translates
$\\{ L\_\gamma\phi:\gamma\in\Gamma\\}$ on the _Heisenberg_ group $\mathbb{H}^n$, where
$\phi\in L^2(\mathbb{H}^n)$ and $\Gamma$ is a lattice in $\mathbb{H}^n$. We take
$\Gamma=\{(2k,l,m):k,l\in\mathbb{Z}^n,m\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ as the standard lattice in order
to avoid computational complexity. Recently it has been proved that if
$\phi\in L^2(\mathbb{H}^n)$ is such that
\begin{equation}
\sum\_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}\left\langle \widehat{\phi}(\lambda+r),\widehat{L_{(2k,l,0)}\phi}(\lambda+r)
\right\rangle\_{\mathcal{B}\_2}|\lambda+r|^n=0\ a.e.\ \lambda\in(0,1],
\end{equation}
for all $(k,l)\in\mathbb{Z}^{2n}\setminus\{(0,0)\}$, then $\\{L\_{(2k,l,m)}\phi:k,l\in\mathbb{Z}^n,
m\in\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is a _Riesz_ sequence if and only if there exist $A,B>0$ such that
\begin{equation}
A\leq \sum\_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}\left\|\widehat{\phi}(\lambda+r)\right\|\_{\mathcal{B}_2}^2|\lambda+r|^n\leq
B\ \ a.e.\ \lambda\in(0,1].
\end{equation}
Here $\widehat{\phi}$ denotes the group _Fourier_ transform of $\phi$ and $\mathcal{B}\_2$ denotes the
_Hilbert_ space of _Hilbert-Schmidt_ operators on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$. In the absence of the above condition,
the requirement of _Riesz_ sequence is given in terms of the Gramian of the system
$\\{\tau\left(L\_{(2k,l,0)}\phi\right)(\lambda):k,l\in\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$ for $\lambda\in(0,1]$, where $\tau$
is the fiber map. We shall discuss these results in the talk along with the computational issues.
