In this talk, I would like to present some recent results regarding the behaviour
of functions which are uniformly bounded under the action of a certain class of
non-convex non-local functionals related to the degree of a map. In the literature,
this class of functionals happens to be a very good substitute of the $L^p$ norm of
the gradient of a Sobolev function. As a consequence various improvements of the
classical Poincaré's inequality, Sobolev's inequality and Rellich-Kondrachov's
compactness criterion were established. This talk will be focused on addressing
the gap between a certain exponential integrability and the boundedness for
functions which are finite under the action of these class of non-convex
functionals.
