Machine Learning, particularly Deep Learning, algorithms are being
increasingly used to approximate solutions of partial differential
equations (PDEs). We survey recent results on different aspects of
deep learning in the context of PDEs namely, 1) Supervised learning
for high-dimensional parametrized PDEs 2) Operator learning for
approximating infinite-dimensional operators which arise in PDEs
and 3) Physics informed Neural Networks for approximating both forward
and inverse problems for PDEs. We will highlight open questions in
the analysis of deep learning algorithms for PDEs.
