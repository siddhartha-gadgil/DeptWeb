We discuss $L^p\to L^q$ estimates for local maximal operators associated with dilates
of codimension two spheres in Heisenberg groups, sharp up to endpoints. The proof shall
be reduced to estimates for standard oscillatory integrals of Carleson--Sjölin--Hörmander
type, relying on the maximal possible number of nonvanishing curvatures for a cone in the
fibers of the associated canonical relation. We shall also discuss a new counterexample
which shows the sharpness of one of the edges in the region of boundedness. Based on
joint work with Joris Roos and Andreas Seeger.
