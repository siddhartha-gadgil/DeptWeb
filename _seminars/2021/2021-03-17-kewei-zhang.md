In this talk I will present a quantization approach which directly relates Fujita-Odaka's delta-invariant to the optimal exponent of certain Moser-Trudinger 
type inequality on polarized manifolds. As a consequence we obtain new criterions for the existence of twisted Kahler-Einstein metrics or constant scalar 
curvature Kahler metrics on possibly non-Fano manifolds.
