We will consider some results for non-local ODE with good conformal properties.
These include equations with a fractional Laplacian and a Hardy-type critical
potential. It turns out that conformal geometry provides a powerful tool to handle
such non-local ODE. We will classify the asymptotic behavior of solutions and
give a generalized notion of Wronskian, for instance, together with some applications.
