 In the late 1980s, Nigel Hitchin and Michael Wolf independently discovered a parametrization of the Teichm端ller space of a compact surface by holomorphic 
 quadratic differentials. In this talk, I will describe work in progress on a generalization of their result. I will review the definition of the 
 "enhanced Teichm端ller space" which has been widely studied in the mathematical physics and cluster algebra literature. I will then describe a version of the 
 result of Hitchin and Wolf which relates meromorphic quadratic differentials to the enhanced Teichm端ller space. This builds on earlier work by a number of 
 authors, including Wolf, Lohkamp, Gupta, and Biswas-Gastesi-Govindarajan.
