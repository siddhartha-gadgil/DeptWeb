Let $G$ be the group $SL_2$ over a finite extension $F$ of
$\mathbb{Q}_p$, $p$ odd. I will discuss certain distributions on $G(F)$,
belonging to what is called its Bernstein center (I will explain what
this and many other terms in this abstract mean), supported in a certain
explicit subset of $G(F)$ arising from the work of A. Moy and G. Prasad.
The assertion is that these distributions form a subring of the Bernstein
center, and that convolution with these distributions has very agreeable
properties with respect to orbital integrals. These are 'depth $r$
versions' of results proved for general reductive groups by J.-F. Dat, R.
Bezrukavnikov, A. Braverman and D. Kazhdan.
