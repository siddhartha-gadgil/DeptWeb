Many models of one dimensional random growth are expected to lie
in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. For a few
such models, the limiting interface profile, after scaling by 
characteristic KPZ scaling exponents of one-third and two-third,
is known to be the Airy_2 process shifted by a parabola. This
limiting process is expected to be "locally Brownian", and a
recent result gives a quantified bound on probabilities of events
under the Airy_2 process on a unit order interval in terms of
probabilities of the same events under Brownian motion (of rate
two). This comparison also holds in the prelimit for the
particular model of Brownian last passage percolation. In this
talk, we will introduce KPZ universality and discuss this result
and a number of consequences, using last passage percolation as
an expository framework.

Joint work with Jacob Calvert and Alan Hammond.
