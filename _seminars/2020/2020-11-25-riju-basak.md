In 1987, A. Bonami and S. Poornima proved that a non-constant
function which is homogeneous of degree zero cannot be a Fourier
multiplier on homogeneous Sobolev spaces. In this talk, we will
discuss the Fourier multipliers on Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$
and Weyl multipliers on $\mathbb{C}^n$ acting on Sobolev spaces.
We define a notion of homogeneity of degree zero for bounded operators
on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and establish analogous results for Fourier
multipliers on Heisenberg group and Weyl multipliers on $\mathbb{C}^n$
acting on Sobolev spaces. This talk is based on the recent work with
Rahul Garg and Sundaram Thangavelu.
