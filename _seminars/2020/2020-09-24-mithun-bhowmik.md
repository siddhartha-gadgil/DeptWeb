An $L^2$ version of the celebrated Denjoy-Carleman theorem regarding quasi-analytic
functions was proved by Chernoff on $\mathbb{R}^d$ using iterates of the Laplacian. 
In 1934, Ingham used the classical Denjoy-Carleman theorem to relate the decay
of Fourier transform and quasi-analyticity of an integrable function on $\mathbb{R}$. 
In this talk, we discuss analogues of the theorems of Chernoff and Ingham for
Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type and show that the theorem of Ingham
follows from that of Chernoff.
