I will discuss some aspects of SYZ mirror symmetry for pairs $(X,D)$ where $X$ is a del Pezzo surface or a rational elliptic surface 
and $D$ is an anti-canonical divisor.  In particular I will explain the existence of special Lagrangian fibrations, mirror symmetry 
for (suitably interpreted) Hodge numbers and,  if time permits, I will describe a proof of SYZ mirror symmetry conjecture for del Pezzo surfaces.  
This is joint work with Adam Jacob and Yu-Shen Lin.
