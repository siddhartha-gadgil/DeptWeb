Given a Galois extension of number fields $K/F$ and two elliptic curves $A$
and $B$ with equivalent residual Galois representation mod $p$, for an odd
prime $p$, we will discuss the relation between the $p$-parity conjecture of
$A$ twisted by $\sigma$ and that of $B$ twisted by $\sigma$ for an irreducible,
self dual, Artin representation $\sigma$ of the Galois group of $K/F$. 

This is a joint work with Somnath Jha and Tathagata Mandal.
