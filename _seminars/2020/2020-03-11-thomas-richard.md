Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold and 'c' be some homology class of M. The systole of c is the minimum of the k-volume over 
all possible representatives of c. We will use combine recent works of Gromov and Zhu to show an upper bound for the 
systole of [S^2x{*}]  under the assumption that [S^2x{*}] contains two representatives which are far enough from each other.
