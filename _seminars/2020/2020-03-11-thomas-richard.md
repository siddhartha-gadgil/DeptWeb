Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and '$c$' be some homology class of $M$. The systole of $c$ is the minimum of the $k$-volume over 
all possible representatives of $c$. We will use combine recent works of Gromov and Zhu to show an upper bound for the 
systole of $S^2 \times \\{\*\\}$ under the assumption that $S^2 \times \\{\*\\}$ contains two representatives which are far enough from each other.
