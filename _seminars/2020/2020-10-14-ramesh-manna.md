In this talk, we discuss Carleman estimates for Laplacian, which
implies strong unique continuation for $-\Delta u+Vu$ with potential
$V \in L^{\infty}.$ We briefly discuss unique continuation in certain
critical situations such as when the potential is in $L^{n/2}\_{loc}$
assuming Fourier restriction theorems. Then $L^{n/2}\_{loc}$ case is a
well-known result of Kenig-Jerison. Our proof of unique continuation
is based on the Carleman estimate where it is a consequence of the
spectral gap of Laplace Beltrami on the sphere.
