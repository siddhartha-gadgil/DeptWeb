In this talk, we will try to characterize eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator using
Fourier multipliers via Roe-Strichartz type theorems in rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type.
This work has its origin in a simple result of Roe, which says that if all the derivatives and
antiderivatives of a given function on the real line are uniformly bounded, then the function is 
a linear combination of sin(x) and cos(x). We will talk about ramification of this result in context
of characterizing eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The talk will be based on a joint
work with Prof. Rudra P. Sarkar.
