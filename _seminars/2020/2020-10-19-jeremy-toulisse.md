The pseudo-hyperbolic space $H^{2,n}$ is the pseudo-Riemannian
analogue of the classical hyperbolic space. In this talk, I will explain
how to solve an asymptotic Plateau problem in this space: given a
topological circle in the boundary at infinity of $H^{2,n}$, we construct a unique
complete maximal surface bounded by this circle. This construction
relies on Gromov's theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves. This is a joint
work with Fran√ßois Labourie and Mike Wolf.
