Recall that an _excedance_ of a permutation $\pi$ is any position
$i$ such that $\pi_i > i$. Inspired by the work of Hopkins, McConville
and Propp (arXiv:1612.06816) on sorting using toppling, we say that a
permutation is toppleable if it gets sorted by a certain sequence of
toppling moves. For the most part of the talk, we will explain the main
ideas in showing that the number of toppleable permutations on $n$ letters
is the same as those for which excedances happen exactly at $\\{1,\dots,
\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor\\}$. Time permitting, we will give some ideas
showing that this is also the number of acyclic orientations with unique
sink of the complete bipartite graph $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil, \lfloor n/2
\rfloor + 1}$.

This is joint work with P. Tetali (GATech) and D. Hathcock (CMU), and is
available at arXiv:2010.11236.
