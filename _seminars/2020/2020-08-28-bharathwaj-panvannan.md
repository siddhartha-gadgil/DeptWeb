In classical Iwasawa theory, one studies a relationship called the Iwasawa main
conjecture, between an analytic object (the p-adic L-function) and an algebraic
object (the Selmer group).  This relationship involves codimension one cycles of
an Iwasawa algebra.  The topic of higher codimension Iwasawa theory seeks to
generalize this relationship. We will describe a result in this topic using
codimension two cycles, involving an elliptic curve with supersingular reduction.
This is joint work with Antonio Lei.
