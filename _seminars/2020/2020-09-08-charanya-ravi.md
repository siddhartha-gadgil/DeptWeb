 Cohomology theories are one of the most important algebraic
 invariants of topological spaces and this has inspired the
 definition of several different cohomology theories in algebraic
 geometry. In this talk, we focus on algebraic K-theory, which is
 one such classical cohomological invariant of algebraic varieties.
 After motivating and introducing this notion, we discuss several
 fundamental properties of algebraic K-theory of varieties with
 algebraic group actions. Well-known examples of varieties with
 group actions include toric varieties and flag varieties.
