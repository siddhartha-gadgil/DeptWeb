Let $X_1,X_2, X_3$ be Banach  spaces of measurable functions in
$L^0(\mathbb R)$ and let $m(\xi,\eta)$ be a locally integrable
function in $\mathbb R^2$. We say that
$m\in \mathcal{BM}\_{(X_1,X_2,X_3)}(\mathbb R)$ if
\begin{equation}
B_m(f,g)(x)=\int_\mathbb{R} \int_\mathbb{R} \hat{f}(\xi)
\hat{g}(\eta)m(\xi,\eta)e^{2\pi i \langle\xi+\eta, x\rangle}d\xi d\eta,
\end{equation}
defined for $f$ and $g$ with compactly supported Fourier transform,
extends to a bounded bilinear operator from $X_1 \times X_2$ to $X_3$.

In this talk we present some properties of the class
$\mathcal{BM}\_{(X_1,X_2,X_3)}(\mathbb R)$ for general spaces which are
invariant under translation, modulation and dilation, analyzing also the
particular case of r.i. Banach function spaces. We shall give some
examples in this class and some procedures to generate new bilinear
multipliers. We shall focus in the case $m(\xi,\eta)=M(\xi-\eta)$ and
find conditions for these classes to contain non zero multipliers in
terms of the Boyd indices for the spaces.
