Given a vector bundle of arbitrary rank with ample determinant line
bundle on a projective manifold, we propose a new elliptic system of
differential equations of Hermitian-Yang-Mills type for the curvature
tensor. The system is designed so that solutions provide Hermitian
metrics with positive curvature in the sense of Griffiths â€“ and even
in the dual Nakano sense. As a consequence, if an existence result
could be obtained for every ample vector bundle, the Griffiths
conjecture on the equivalence between ampleness and positivity of
vector bundles would be settled. Another outcome of the approach is a
new concept of volume for vector bundles.
