For a finite abelian group $G$ and $A \subset [1, \exp(G) - 1]$, the
$A$-weighted Davenport Constant $D_A(G)$ is defined to be the least
positive integer $k$ such that any sequence $S$ with length $k$ over $G$
has a non-empty $A$-weighted zero-sum subsequence. The original motivation
for studying Davenport Constant was the problem of non-unique
factorization in number fields. The precise value of this invariant for
the cyclic group for certain sets $A$ is known but the general case is
still unknown. Typically an extremal problem deals with the problem of
determining or estimating the maximum or minimum possible cardinality of
a collection of finite objects that satisfies certain requirements. In a
recent work with Prof. Niranjan Balachandran, we introduced an Extremal
Problem for a finite abelian group related to Weighted Davenport
Constant. In this talk I will talk about the behaviour of it for
different groups, specially for cyclic group.
