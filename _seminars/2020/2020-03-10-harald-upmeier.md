The second part of the lectures on multi-variable automorphic forms emphasizes relations
to harmonic analysis and operator algebras, together with some explicit constructions
of automorphic forms.

Lectures 1--4 (Jan 14, 16, 29, Feb 5):
* Automorphic Forms on Semisimple Lie Groups
* Construction of Automorphic Forms (Eisenstein series and Theta functions),
relations to number theory in higher dimension
* Automorphic Forms in Berezin Quantization and von Neumann Algebras

Lecture 5. Multivariable Scattering Theory (Tuesday, March 10)
