Let $G$ be an algebraic group defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}\_q$
and let $m$ be a positive integer. Shintani descent is a relationship
between the character theories of the two finite groups $G(\mathbb{F}\_q)$
and $G(\mathbb{F}\_{q^m})$ of $\mathbb{F}\_q$ and $\mathbb{F}\_{q^m}$-valued
points of $G$ respectively. This was first studied by Shintani for
$G=GL_n$. Later, Shoji studied Shintani descent for connected reductive
groups and related it to Lusztig's theory of character sheaves. In this
talk, I will speak on the cases where $G$ is a unipotent or solvable
algebraic group. I will also explain the relationship with the theory of
character sheaves.
