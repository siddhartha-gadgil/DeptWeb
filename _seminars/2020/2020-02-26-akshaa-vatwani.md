We consider  $L$-functions $L_1,\ldots,L_k$ from the Selberg
class having polynomial Euler product and satisfying Selberg's
orthonormality condition. We show that on every vertical line
$s=\sigma+it$ in the complex plane with $\sigma \in(1/2,1)$,
these $L$-functions simultaneously take "large" values  inside
a small neighborhood.

This is joint work with Kamalakshya Mahatab and Lukasz Pankowski.
