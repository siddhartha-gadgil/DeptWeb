I will discuss totally positive/non-negative matrices and kernels, including
Polya frequency (PF) functions and sequences. This includes examples, history,
and basic results on total positivity, variation diminution, sign non-reversal,
and generating functions of PF sequences (with some proofs). I will end with
applications of total positivity to old and new phenomena involving Schur polynomials.
