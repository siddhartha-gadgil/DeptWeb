In 2004, Corvaja and Zannier proved an extension of Roth's theorem on
rational approximation of algebraic numbers. With a collaboration of Dr.
Veekesh Kumar, we proved a simultaneous version of Corvaja and Zannier's
result. These results are applications of a strong form of the Subspace
Theorem. In this talk, we shall discuss the motivation of Corvaja and
Zannier's result and our generalization.
