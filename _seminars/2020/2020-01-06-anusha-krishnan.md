We will discuss some work on the Ricci flow on manifolds with symmetries. In particular, cohomogeneity one manifolds, 
i.e. a Riemannian manifold M with an isometric action by a Lie group G such that the orbit space M/G is one-dimensional. 
We will also explain how this relates to diagonalizing the Ricci tensor on Lie groups and homogeneous spaces.
