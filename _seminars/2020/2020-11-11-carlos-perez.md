In this expository lecture we will discuss some recent results
concerning fractional Poincaré and Poincaré-Sobolev inequalities with
weights, the degeneracy. These results improve some well known estimates
due to Fabes-Kenig-Serapioni from the 80’s in connection with the local
regularity of solutions of degenerate elliptic equations and also some
more recent results by Bourgain-Brezis-Minorescu. Our approach is
different from the usual ones and is based on methods that come from
Harmonic Analysis. This is especially visible when the connection of
this theory with the BMO space and its different variants will be shown.
