The affine Demazure modules are the Demazure modules that occur in a level
$\ell$ irreducible integrable representation of an affine Lie algebra. We
call them $\mathfrak{g}$-stable if they are stable under the action of the
standard maximal parabolic subalgebra of the affine Lie algebra. We prove
that such a $\mathfrak{g}$-stable affine Demazure module is isomorphic to
the fusion (tensor) product of smaller $\mathfrak{g}$-stable affine Demazure
modules, thus completing the main theorems of Chari et al. (J. Algebra, 2016)
and Kus et al. (Represent. Theory, 2016). We obtain a new combinatorial proof 
for the key fact that was used in Chari et al. (op cit.), to prove the
decomposition of $\mathfrak{g}$-stable affine Demazure modules. Our proof for
this key fact is uniform, avoids the case-by-case analysis, and works for all
finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.
