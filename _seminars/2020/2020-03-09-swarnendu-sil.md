The analysis for Yang-Mills functional and in general, problems related to higher dimensional gauge theory, 
often requires one to work with weak notions of principal G-bundles and connections on them. The bundle transition 
functions for such bundles are not continuous and thus there is no obvious notion of a topological isomorphism class. 

In this talk, we shall discuss a few natural classes of weak bundles with connections which can be approximated in 
the appropriate norm topology by smooth connections on smooth bundles. We also show how we can associate a topological 
isomorphism class to such bundle-connection pairs, which is invariant under weak gauge changes. In stark contrast 
to classical notions, this topological isomorphism class is not independent of the connection.
