We discuss a set of purely sequential strategies to estimate an unknown negative binomial
mean $\mu$ under different forms of loss functions. We develop point estimation techniques
where the thatch parameter $\tau$ may be known or unknown. Both asymptotic first-order
efficiency and risk efficiency properties will be elaborated. The results will be supported
by an extensive set of data analysis carried out via computer simulations for a wide variety
of sample sizes. We observe that all of our purely sequential estimation strategies perform
remarkably well under different situations. We also illustrate the implementation of these
methodologies using real datasets from ecology, namely, weed count data and data on
migrating woodlarks.
