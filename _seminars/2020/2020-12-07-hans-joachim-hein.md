Yau's solution of the Calabi conjecture provided the first nontrivial examples of Ricci-flat Riemannian metrics on compact manifolds. 
Attempts to understand the degeneration patterns of these metrics in families have revealed many remarkable phenomena over the years. 
I will review some aspects of this story and present recent joint work with Valentino Tosatti where we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion 
(locally uniformly away from the singular fibers) of Calabi-Yau metrics collapsing along a holomorphic fibration of a fixed compact Calabi-Yau manifold. 
This relies on a new analytic method where each additional term of the expansion arises as the obstruction to proving a uniform bound on one additional 
derivative of the remainder.
