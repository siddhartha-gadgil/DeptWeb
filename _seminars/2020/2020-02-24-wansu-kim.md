We start with reviewing Dwork's seminal work on a certain $p$-adic
hypergeometric function, which has an application to the unit-root
$L$-function of the Legendre family of elliptic curves in characteristic
$p>2$. Then I would like to overview what can be said about unit-root
$L$-function of the family of abelian varieties over a curve, and
discuss its potential applications.
