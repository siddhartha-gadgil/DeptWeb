In the 1980's Tate stated the Brumer--Stark conjecture which,
for a totally real field $F$ with prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$,
conjectures the existence of a $\mathfrak{p}$-unit called the
Gross--Stark unit.  This unit has $\mathfrak{P}$ order equal
to the value of a partial zeta function at 0, for a prime
$\mathfrak{P}$ above $\mathfrak{p}$. In 2008 and 2018 Dasgupta
and Dasgupta--Spie&szlig;, conjectured formulas for this unit.
During this talk I shall explain Tate's conjecture and then
the ideas for the constructions of these formulas. I will
finish by explaining the results I have obtained from comparing
these formulas.
