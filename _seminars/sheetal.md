title: Control and analysis of Shell model of Turbulence
---
Abstract:

In this lecture I am going to present control problems associated with
shell models of Turbulence. Shell models of turbulence are simplified
caricatures of equations of fluid mechanics in wave-vector representation.
 They exhibit anomalous scaling and local non-linear interactions in wave
number space. We would like to study control problem related to one such
widely accepted shell model of turbulence known as sabra shell model. We
associate two cost functionals: one ensures minimizing  turbulence in the
system and the other addresses the need of taking the ow near a priori
known state. We derive the optimal controls in terms of the solution of
adjoint equation for corresponding linearised problems.
