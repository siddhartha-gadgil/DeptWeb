We shall discuss the difficulty in solving and numerically integrating
differential-algebraic equation systems of the dx/dt = f(x,u), g(x) = 0
where x is in R^n and u is in R^m and m <= n. In this context we shall
introduce a horizontal lift and its exponentiation toward construction
of a solution. Especially, the solution and behavior of the algebraic
variable is of interest. Cases where u can be rough (belong to fractional
Hoelder space) are of interest. A numerical approximation that can
produce useful results in computer simulations will be discussed.
