A compact subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$ is polynomially convex if it is
defined by a (possibly infinite) family of polynomial inequalities.
In this talk, we will discuss some questions and recent results
regarding the minimum embedding (complex) dimension of abstract
compact (real) manifolds subject to such convexity constraints.
These embeddings arise naturally in connection with higher-dimensional
analogues of the fact that the algebra of continuous functions on
a circle can be generated by two smooth functions. We will expand
on this connection, discuss the local and global challenges in
constructing such embeddings, and discuss two distinct cases in
which new bounds have been obtained.This is joint work with R. Shafikov.
