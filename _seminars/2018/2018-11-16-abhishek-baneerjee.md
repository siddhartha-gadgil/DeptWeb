An ordinary ring may be seen as a preadditive category
with just one object. This leads to the powerful analogy,
first formulated explicitly by Mitchell in 1975, that a
small preadditive category should be seen as a "ring with
several objects". We will trace the history and development
of the category of modules over a preadditive category.
