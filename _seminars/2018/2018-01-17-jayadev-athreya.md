In joint work with Steve Lalley and Jenya Sapir, we study the tessellation of a compact, hyperbolic surface induced by a typical long geodesic segment. We show, that when properly scaled, the local behavior of a typical geodesic is that of a Poisson line process. This implies that the global statistics of the tessellation -- for instance, the fraction of triangles -- approach those of the limiting Poisson line process.
