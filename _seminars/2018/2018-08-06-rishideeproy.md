We consider the collection of near maxima of the discrete log-correlated Gaussian field in the interior of a box. We provide a rough description of the geometry of the set of near maxima. We show that two near maxima can other either simultaneously either at microscopic or at macroscopic level, but not at mesoscopic level.
