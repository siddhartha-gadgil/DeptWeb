Valuations are a classical topic in convex geometry. The volume plays an
important role in many structural results, such as Hadwiger’s famous
characterization of continuous, rigid-motion invariant valuations on
convex bodies. Valuations whose domain is restricted to lattice
polytopes are less well-studied. The Betke-Kneser Theorem establishes a
fascinating discrete analog of Hadwiger’s Theorem for lattice-invariant
valuations on lattice polytopes in which the number of lattice points —
the discrete volume — plays a fundamental role. In this talk, we explore
striking parallels, analogies and also differences between the world of
valuations on convex bodies and those on lattice polytopes with a focus
on positivity questions and links to Ehrhart theory.
