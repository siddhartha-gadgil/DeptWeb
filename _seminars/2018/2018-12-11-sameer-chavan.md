The wandering subspace problem for ananalytic (norm-increasing)
m-isometry T on a Hilbert space H asks whether every T-invariant subspace
of H can be generated by a wandering subspace. An affirmative solution to
this problem for m = 1 is ascribed to Beurling-Lax-Halmos, while that for
m = 2 is due to Richter. In this talk, we discuss present status of this
problem including some partial solutions in case m > 2.
