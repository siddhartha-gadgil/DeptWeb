The non-commutative generalisation of the notion of stopping time
was introduced by Hudson. Such quantum stopping times may be used
to stop the CCR flow and its isometric cocycles, i.e., left operator
Markovian cocycles on Boson Fock space. This stopping of the CCR
flow yields a homomorphism from the semigroup of stopping times
into the semigroup of unital endomorphisms of the algebra of
bounded operators on the ambient Fock space, and this homomorphism
is a generalised version of the shift semigroup. Moreover, stopped
cocycles satisfy a non-deterministic version of the cocycle relation,
which is a significant generalisation of a result of Applebaum.
