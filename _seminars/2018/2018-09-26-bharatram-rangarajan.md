The aim of this talk is to give a high-level overview of the theory
of expander graphs and introduce motivations and possible approaches
to generalizing it to higher dimensions. I shall begin with three
perspectives on expansion in graphs- discrepancy, isoperimetry and
mixing time, and show a qualitative equivalence of these notions in
defining expansion for graphs. Next I shall briefly discuss upper and
lower bounds on expansion, and sketch the Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak
construction of Ramanujan graphs. Finally, I hope to motivate
high-dimensional expanders using two interesting topics- the
overlapping problem, and the threshold problem.
