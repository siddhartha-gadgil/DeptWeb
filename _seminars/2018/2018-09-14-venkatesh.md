Let $G$ be a finite simple graph. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$
is defined as follows: $\\mathfrak{g}$ is generated by the vertices of $G$
modulo the relations $[u, v]=0$ if there is no edge between the vertices
$u$ and $v$. Many properties of $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be obtained from the
properties of $G$ and vice versa. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$
is naturally graded and the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra
$\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ have some deep connections with the vertex
colorings of $G$. In this talk, I will explain how to get the generalized
chromatic polynomials of $G$ in terms of graded dimensions of the Lie
algebra of $G$. We will use this connection to give a Lie theoretic proof
of of Stanleyâ€™s reciprocity theorem of chromatic polynomials.
