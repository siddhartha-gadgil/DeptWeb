We study operators of multiplication by $z^k$ in Dirichlet-type
spaces $D_\alpha$. We establish the existence of $k$ and $\alpha$
for which some $z^k$-invariant subspaces of $D_\alpha$ do not satisfy
the wandering property. As a consequence of the proof, any
Dirichlet-type space accepts an equivalent norm under which the
wandering property fails for some space for the operator of
multiplication by $z^k$ for any $k \geq 6$.
