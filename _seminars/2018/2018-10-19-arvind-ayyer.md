Characters of classical groups appear in the enumeration of many
interesting combinatorial problems. We show that, for a wide
class of partitions, and for an even number of variables of
which half are reciprocals of the other half, Schur functions
(i.e., characters of the general linear group) factorize into
a product of two characters of other classical groups. Time
permitting, we will present similar results involving sums of
two Schur functions. All the proofs will involve elementary
applications of ideas from linear algebra.

This is joint work with Roger Behrend.
