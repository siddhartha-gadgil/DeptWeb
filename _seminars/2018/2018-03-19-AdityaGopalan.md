We will begin by providing a brief introduction to
self-normalizing concentration inequalities for scalar and
finite-dimensional martingales, which are very useful in measuring the
size of a stochastic process in terms of another, growing, process (the
2009 book of de la Pena et al is a good reference). We will then present
a self-normalizing concentration inequality for martingales that live in
the (potentially infinite-dimensional) Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
(RKHS) of a p.s.d. kernel. We will conclude by illustrating applications
to online kernel least-squares regression and multi-armed bandits with
infinite action spaces, a.k.a. sequential noisy function optimization
