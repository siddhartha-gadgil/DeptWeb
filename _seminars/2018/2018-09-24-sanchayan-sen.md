Start with a system of particles with possibly different masses, and
consider a process where the particles merge, as time passes, according
to some random mechanism. At some point of time the identity of the most
massive particle--the leader--becomes fixed. We study the fixation time
of the identity of the leader in the general setting of Aldous's
multiplicative coalescent, which in an asymptotic sense describes the
evolution of the component sizes of a wide array of near-critical
coalescent processes, including the classical Erdos-Renyi process.
In particular, this generalizes a result of Luczak.
Based on joint work with Louigi Addario-Berry and Shankar Bhamidi.
