title: A quantitative form of Schoenberg's theorem in fixed dimension (Joint work with D. Guillot, A. Khare and M. Putinar)
---

Abstract : The Hadamard product of two matrices is formed by multiplying
corresponding entries, and the Schur product theorem states that
this operation preserves positive semidefiniteness.

It follows immediately that every analytic function with non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients, when applied entrywise, preserves positive
semidefiniteness for matrices of any order. The converse is due to
Schoenberg: a function which preserves positive semidefiniteness for
matrices of arbitrary order is necessarily analytic and has non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients.

For matrices of fixed order, the situation is more interesting. This talk
will present recent work which shows the existence of polynomials with
negative leading term which preserve positive semidefiniteness, and
characterises precisely how large this term may be.
