We will show both original and known results on Harmonic Analysis for
functions defined on the infinite-dimensional torus, which is the
topological compact group consisting of the Cartesian product of
countably infinite many copies of the one-dimensional torus, with
its corresponding Haar measure. Such results will include:
1. Fourier Analysis on $\mathbb{T}^{\omega}$: basic properties,
absolutely divergent series, Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition
and differentiation of integrals.
2. Mixed norm $L^{\bar{p}}(\mathbb{T}^{\omega})$ spaces,
$\bar{p}=(p_1,p_2,\ldots)$: definition, properties, duality,
interpolation and weak spaces.
3. M. Riesz Theorems on $\mathbb{T}^{\omega}$, a.e. convergence,
rectangular partial sums and $L^{\bar{p}}$ convergence.

Several open problems and other questions will be considered.  Some of
the results presented are joint work with Emilio Fernandez
(Universidad de La Rioja, Spain).
