An ordinary ring may be expressed as a preadditive category with a
single object. Accordingly, as introduced by B. Mitchel, an arbitrary
small preadditive category may be understood as a "ring with several
objects". In this respect, for a Hopf algebra H, an H-category will
denote an "H-module algebra with several objects" and a co-H-category
will denote an "H-comodule algebra with several objects". Modules over
such Hopf categories were first considered by Cibils and Solotar. In
this talk, we present a study of cohomology in such module categories.

In particular, we consider H-equivariant modules over a Hopf module
category C as modules over the smash extension C#H. We construct
Grothendieck spectral sequences for the cohomologies as well as the
H-locally finite cohomologies of these objects. We also introduce
relative (D,H)-Hopf modules over a Hopf comodule category D. These
generalize relative (A,H)-Hopf modules over an H-comodule algebra A.
We construct Grothendieck spectral sequences for their cohomologies
by using their rational Hom objects and higher derived functors of
coinvariants.
