The talk will focus on congruences modulo a prime $p$ of arithmetic
invariants that are associated to the Iwasawa theory of Galois
representations arising from elliptic curves. These congruences
fit in the framework of some deep conjectures in Iwasawa theory
which relate arithmetic and analytic invariants.
