We investigate the properties of a random walk on the alternating group
$A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(i,n-1,n)$ and $(i,n,n-1)$. We
call this the transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle. We find the spectrum
of the transition matrix for this shuffle. We mainly use the
representation theory of alternating group. We show that the mixing time
is of order $\left(n-\frac{3}{2}\right)\log n$ and prove that there is a
total variation cutoff for this shuffle.
