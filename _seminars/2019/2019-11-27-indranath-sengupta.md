We will present some recent studies on ideals of the
form $I_{1}(XY)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are matrices whose
entries are polynomials of degree at most 1. We will discuss, 
how a good Groebner basis for these ideals help us compute
primary decompositions and gather various other homological 
informations.
