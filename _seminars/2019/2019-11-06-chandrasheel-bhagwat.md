We will discuss certain rationality results for the critical values of
the degree-$2n$ $L$-functions attached to $GL\_1 \times O(n,n)$ over a
totally real number field for an even positive integer $n$. We will
also discuss some relations for Deligne periods of motives. This is
part of a joint work with A. Raghuram.
