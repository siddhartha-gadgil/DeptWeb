 Integer partitions have been an interesting combinatorial
 object for centuries but we still have a lot left to understand.
 In this talk we will see an uncommon way to view partitions
 using 'Abaci' and use this to illustrate partition division
 (defining t-cores and t-quotients of a given integer partition).
 I am planning to go in more detail with a special kind of
 partition called t-core (partitions) and discuss different
 ways to enumerate related objects.
