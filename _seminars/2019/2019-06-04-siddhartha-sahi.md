We construct certain representations of affine Hecke
algebras and Weyl groups, which depend on several
auxiliary parameters.  We refer to these as "metaplectic"
representations, and as a direct consequence we obtain a
family of "metaplectic" polynomials, which generalizes
the well-known Macdonald polynomials.

Our terminology is motivated by the fact that if the
parameters are specialized to certain Gauss sums, then
our construction recovers the Kazhdan-Patterson action
on metaplectic forms for GL(n); more generally it recovers
the Chinta-Gunnells action on p-parts of Weyl group multiple
Dirichlet series. 

This is joint work with Jasper Stokman and Vidya Venkateswaran.
