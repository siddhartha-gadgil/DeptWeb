Let $\mathfrak{O}$ be the ring of integers of a non-Archimedean local
field such that the residue field has characteristic $p$. Then the
abscissa of convergence of representation zeta function of Special Linear
group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathfrak{O})$ is $1.$ The case $p\neq 2$ is already
known in the literature. For $p=2$ we need more tools to prove the
result. In this talk I will discuss the difference between those cases
and give an outline of the proof for $p=2.$

Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be the maximal ideal of $\mathfrak{O}$ and
$|\mathfrak{O}/\mathfrak{p}|=q.$ It is already shown in literature that
for $r \geq 1,$  the group algebras  $\mathbb
C[\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathfrak{O}/\mathfrak{p}^{r})]$ and  $\mathbb
C[\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb F_q[t]/(t^{r}))]$ are isomorphic. Also for
$2\nmid q,$  the group algebras $\mathbb
C[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathfrak{O}/\mathfrak{p}^{r})]$ and  $\mathbb
C[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb F_q[t]/(t^{r}))]$ are isomorphic. In this talk I
will also show that if $2\mid q$ and $\mathrm{char}(\mathfrak{O})=0$
then,  the group algebras,
$\mathbb C[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathfrak{O}/\mathfrak{p}^{2\ell})]$ and
$\mathbb C[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb F_q[t]/(t^{2\ell}))]$ are <i>not</i>
isomorphic for $\ell > \mathrm{e}$, where $\mathrm{e}$ is the
ramification index of $\mathfrak{O}.$
