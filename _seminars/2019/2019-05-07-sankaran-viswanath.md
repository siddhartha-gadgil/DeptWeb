Consider the tensor product of two irreducible finite dimensional
representations of a simple Lie algebra. The submodules generated
by a tensor product of extremal vectors of the two components are
called Kostant-Kumar submodules. These are parametrized by a double
coset space of the Weyl group. 

Littelmann's path model is a very general combinatorial model for
representations, which encompasses many classical constructs such
as Young tableaux and Lakshmibai-Seshadri chains. The path model
for the full tensor product is simply the set of concatenations of
paths of the individual components. We describe a way to associate
a Weyl group element (rather, a double coset) to each such concatenated
path and thereby obtain a path model for Kostant-Kumar submodules. 

Finally, we recall the many descriptions of Demazure modules, which
may be viewed as the analog of the above picture for single paths
(rather than concatenations). In this case, the Weyl group element
associated to a path admits different descriptions in different path
models in terms of statistics such as initial direction, minimal
standard lifts and Kogan faces of Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes. Along
the way, we mention some relations to jeu-de-taquin and the
Schutzenberger involution. 

This is based on joint work with Mrigendra Singh Kushwaha and
KN Raghavan.
