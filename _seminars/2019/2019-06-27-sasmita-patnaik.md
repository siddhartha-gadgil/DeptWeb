The study of multiplicative B(H)-semigroups with
selfadjoint-ideals property (called SI semigroups, in short) is related to
the solvability of a certain operator equation. This introduces a new
unitary invariant property for B(H)-semigroups.  We characterized singly
generated SI semigroups for a normal operator and for a rank one operator.
The SI property is closely related to the simplicity of B(H)-semigroups.
