Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ with vertex set $[n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$, a
bisecting family is a family $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}([n])$ such
that for every $B\in\mathcal{H}$, there exists $A\in\mathcal{A}$ with the
property $|A\cap B|-|A\cap\overline{B}|\in\{-1,0,1\}$. Similarly, for a
family of bicolorings $\mathcal{B}\subseteq \{-1,1\}^{[n]}$ of $[n]$ a
family $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}([n])$ is called a System of
Unbiased Representatives for $\mathcal{B}$ if for every $b\in\mathcal{B}$
there exists $A\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $\sum_{x\in A} b(x) =0$.

The problem of optimal families of bisections and bicolorings for
hypergraphs originates from what is referred to as the problem of
Balancing Sets of vectors, and has been the source for a few interesting
extremal problems in combinatorial set theory for about 3 decades now. We
shall consider certain natural extremal functions that arise from the
study of bisections and bicolorings and bounds for these extremal
functions. Many of the proofs involve the use of polynomial methods (not
the Polynomial Method, though!).
