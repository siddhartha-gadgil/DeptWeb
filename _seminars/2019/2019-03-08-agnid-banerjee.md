I will discuss a strong unique continuation theorem for zero order perturbations of the fractional heat equation 
based on a monotonicity property of a generalized Almgren frequency in weighted Gauss space. This is a joint work 
with Nicola Garofalo. If time permits,  I will also talk on  how such a truncated variant of the Almgren type  
monotonicity formula combined  with new Weiss and Monneau type monotonicity formulas allows  to study the  structure 
of the singular set on the free boundary   in  the obstacle problem for the  fractional heat operator. 
This part of the talk ( if at all I get time !) is joint with Donatella Danielli, Nicola Garofalo and Arshak Petrosyan.
