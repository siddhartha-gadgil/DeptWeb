In 2001, Jeff Kahn showed that a disjoint union of $n/(2d)$ copies of the
complete bipartite graph $K_{d,d}$ maximizes the number of independent
sets over all $d$-regular bipartite graphs on n vertices, using Shearer's
entropy inequality. In this lecture I will mention several extensions and
generalizations of this extremal result (to graphs and hypergraphs) and
will describe a stability result (in the spectral sense) to Kahn's
result.

The lecture is based on joint works with Emma Cohen, David Galvin, Will
Perkins, Michail Sarantis and Hiep Han.
