 Computing the determinant using the Schur complement of an
 invertible minor is well-known to undergraduates. Perhaps
 less well-known is why this works even when the minor is not
 invertible. Using this and the Cayleyâ€“Hamilton theorem as
 illustrative examples, I will gently explain one "practical"
 usefulness of Zariski density outside commutative algebra.
