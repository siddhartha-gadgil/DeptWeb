We describe the leading terms in the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the
eigenfunctions to an elliptic Dirichlet spectral problem in a thin finite cylindrical
domain with a periodically oscillating boundary by means of homogenization. Under
suitable scaling and structure assumptions, the eigenfunctions show oscillatory behavior,
and asymptotically localize with a profile solving a diffusion equation with quadratic
potential on the real line. Methods for analysis of spectral asymptotics for heterogeneous
media will be briefly discussed.
