Consider the following three properties of a general group $G$:

1. _Algebra:_ $G$ is abelian and torsion-free.

2. _Analysis:_ $G$ is a metric space that admits a "norm", namely, a
translation-invariant metric $d(.,.)$ satisfying: $d(1,g^n) = |n| d(1,g)$
for all $g \in G$ and integers $n$.

3. _Geometry:_ $G$ admits a length function with "saturated"
subadditivity for equal arguments: $\ell(g^2) = 2 \; \ell(g)$ for all $g
\in G$.

While these properties may a priori seem different, in fact they turn out
to be equivalent. The nontrivial implication amounts to saying that there
does not exist a non-abelian group with a "norm".

We will discuss motivations from analysis, probability, and geometry;
then the proof of the above equivalences; and if time permits, the
logistics of how the problem was solved, via a
[PolyMath project](http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Linear_norm)
that began on a
[blogpost](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/bi-invariant-metrics-of-linear-growth-on-the-free-group/)
of Terence Tao.

(Joint - as D.H.J. PolyMath - with Tobias Fritz, Siddhartha Gadgil,
Pace Nielsen, Lior Silberman, and Terence Tao.)
