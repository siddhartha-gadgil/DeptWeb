Representations of Symmetric groups $S_n$ can be considered as
homomorphisms to the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d,\mathbb{R})$,
where $d$ is the degree of the representation. If the determinant
of the representation is trivial, we call it achiral. In this
case, its image lies in the special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(V)$.
It is called chiral otherwise. The group $\mathrm{O}(V)$ has a
non-trivial topological double cover $\mathrm{Pin}(V)$. We say the
representation is spinorial if it lifts to $\mathrm{Pin}(V)$. We
obtained a criterion for whether the representation is spinorial
in terms of its character. We found similar criteria for orthogonal
representations of Alternating groups and products of symmetric
groups. One can use these results to count the number of spinorial
irreducible representations of $S_n$, which are parametrized by
partitions of $n$. We say a partition is spinorial if the corresponding
irreducible representation of $S_n$ is spinorial. In this talk, we
shall present a summary of these results and count for the number of
odd-dimensional, irreducible, achiral, spinorial partitions of $S_n$.
We shall also prove that almost all the irreducible representations
of $S_n$ are achiral and spinorial. This is joint work with my
supervisor Dr. Steven Spallone.
