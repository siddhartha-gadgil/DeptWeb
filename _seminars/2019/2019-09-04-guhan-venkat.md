In his seminal paper in 2001, Henri Darmon proposed a systematic construction of
p-adic points, viz. Stark--Heegner points, on elliptic curves over the rational
numbers. In this talk, I will report on the construction of p-adic cohomology
classes/cycles in the Harris--Soudry--Taylor representation associated to a Bianchi
cusp form, building on the ideas of Henri Darmon and Rotger--Seveso. These local
cohomology classes are conjectured to be the restriction of global cohomology
classes in an appropriate Bloch--Kato Selmer group and have consequences towards
the Bloch--Kato--Beilinson conjecture as well as Gross--Zagier type results. This
is based on a joint work with Chris Williams (Imperial College London).
