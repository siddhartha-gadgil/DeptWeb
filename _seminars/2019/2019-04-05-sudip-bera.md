In this talk we prove that the solution of a general linear recurrence with constant coefficients can be interpreted as the determinant of some suitable matrix using a purely combinatorial method. As a consequence of our approach, we give combinatorial proofs of some recent identities due to Sury and McLaughlin in a unified way.
