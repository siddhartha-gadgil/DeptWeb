We will define an invariant for annular links using the combinatorial link Floer complex that gives genus bounds 
for annular cobordisms.  The celebrated slice-Bennequin inequality relates slice genus of a knot with its contact 
geometric invariants. We investigate similar relations in our context. In particular, we will define an invariant of 
transverse knots that refines the transverse invariant $\theta$ in knot Floer homology.
