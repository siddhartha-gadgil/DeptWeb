The PASEP (partially asymmetric exclusion process) is a toy
model in the physics of dynamical systems strongly related
to the moments of some classical orthogonal polynomials
(Hermite, Laguerre, Askey–Wilson). The partition function
has been interpreted with various combinatorial objects such
as permutations, alternative and tree-like tableaux, etc. We
introduce a new one called "Laguerre heaps of segments", which
seems to play a central role in the network of bijections
relating all these interpretations.
