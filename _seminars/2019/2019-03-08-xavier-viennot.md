The PASEP (partially asymmetric exclusion process) is a toy
model in the physics of dynamical systems strongly related
to the moments of some classical orthogonal polynomials
(Hermite, Laguerre, Askeyâ€“Wilson). The partition function
has been interpreted with various combinatorial objects such
as permutations, alternative and tree-like tableaux, etc. We
introduce a new one called "Laguerre heaps of segments", which
seems to play a central role in the network of bijections
relating all these interpretations.
