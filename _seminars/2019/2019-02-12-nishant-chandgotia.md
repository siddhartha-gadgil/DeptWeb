A topological dynamical system is a pair $(X,T)$ where $T$ is a
homeomorphism of a compact space $X$. A measure preserving action
is a triple $(Y, \mu, S)$ where $Y$ is a standard Borel space, $\mu$
is a probability measure on $X$ and $S$ is a measurable automorphism
of $Y$ which preserves the measure $\mu$. We say that $(X,T)$ is
universal if it can embed any measure preserving action (under some
suitable restrictions). 

Krieger’s generator theorem shows that if $X$ is $A^{\mathbb{Z}}$
(bi-infinite sequences in elements of $A$) and $T$ is the
transformation on $X$ which shifts its elements one unit to the left
then $(X,T)$ is universal. Along with Tom Meyerovitch, we establish
very general conditions under which $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (where now we have
$d$ commuting transformations on $X$)-dynamical systems are universal.
These conditions are general enough to prove that the following
models are universal:

1. A self-homeomorphism with non uniform specification on a compact
metric space (answering a question by Quas and Soo and recovering
recent results by David Burguet).

2. A generic (in the sense of dense $G_\delta$) self-homeomorphism
of the 2-torus preserving Lebesgue measure (extending result by
Lind and Thouvenot to infinite entropy).

3. Proper colourings of the $\mathbb{Z}^d$ lattice with more than
two colours and the domino tilings of the $\mathbb{Z}^2$ lattice
(answering a question by Şahin and Robinson).

Our results also extend to the almost Borel category giving partial
answers to some questions by Gao and Jackson. The talk will not
assume background in ergodic theory and dynamical systems.
