Macdonald polynomials are a remarkable family of orthogonal symmetric polynomials
in several variables. An enormous amount of combinatorics, group theory, algebraic
geometry and representation theory is encoded in these polynomials. It is known
that the characters of level one Demazure modules are non-symmetric Macdonald
polynomials specialized at t=0. In this talk, I will define a class of polynomials
in terms of symmetric Macdonald polynomials and using representation theory we
will see that these polynomials are Schur-positive and are equal to the graded
character of level two Demazure modules for affine $\mathfrak{sl}\_{n+1}$. As an
application we will see how this gives rise to an explicit formula for the graded
multiplicities of level two Demazure modules in the excellent filtration of Weyl
modules. This is based on joint work with Vyjayanthi Chari, Peri Shereen and
Jeffrey Wand.
