A beautiful $q$-series identity found in the unorganized portion of Ramanujan's second
and third notebooks was recently generalized by Maji and I. This identity gives, as a
special case, a three-parameter identity which is a rich source of partition-theoretic
information allowing us to prove, for example, Andrews' famous identity on the smallest
parts function $\mathrm{spt}(n)$, a recent identity of Garvan, and identities on divisor
generating functions, to name a few. Guo and Zeng recently derived a finite analogue of
Uchimura's identity on the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. This
motivated us to look for a finite analogue of my generalization of Ramanujan's
aforementioned identity with Maji. Upon obtaining such a finite version, our quest to
look for a finite version of Andrews' $\mathrm{spt}$-identity necessitated finding
finite analogues of rank, crank and their moments. We could obtain finite versions of
rank and crank for vector partitions. We were also able to obtain a finite analogue of
a partition identity recently conjectured by George Beck and proven by Shane Chern. I
will discuss these and some related results. This is joint work with Pramod Eyyunni,
Bibekananda Maji and Garima Sood.
