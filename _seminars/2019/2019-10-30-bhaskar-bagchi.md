If $T$ is a cnu (completely non-unitary) contraction on a Hilbert
space, then its Nagy-Foias characteristic function is an operator
valued analytic function on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ which is a
complete invariant for the unitary equivalence class of $T$. $T$
is said to be homogeneous if $\varphi(T)$ is unitarily equivalent
to $T$ for all elements $\varphi$ of the group $M$ of biholomorphic
maps on $\mathbb{D}$. A stronger notion is of an associator. $T$
is an associator if there is a projective unitary representation
$\sigma$ of $M$ such that $\varphi(T) = \sigma(\varphi)^*  T
\sigma(\varphi)$ for all $\varphi$ in $M$. In this talk we shall
discuss the following result from a recent work of the speaker
with G. Misra and S. Hazra: A cnu contraction is an associator
if and only if its characteristic function $\theta$ has the
factorization $\theta(z) = \pi_* (\varphi_z) C \pi(\varphi_z),
z \in \mathbb{D}$ for two projective unitary representations
$\pi, \pi_âˆ—$ of $M$.
