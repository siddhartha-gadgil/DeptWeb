Spectral networks are certain decorated graphs drawn on a Riemann surface. 
I will describe a conjectural picture in which spectral networks can be 
viewed as analogues of Hermitian-Einstein metrics on vector bundles, 
and in which holomorphic differentials on the Riemann surface arise 
as stability conditions on certain Fukaya-type categories. 
This talk is based on various joint projects with Fabian Haiden, 
Ludmil Katzarkov, Maxim Kontsevich, and Carlos Simpson.
