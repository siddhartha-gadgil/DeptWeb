Let $F$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}\_p$, and let $E$ be a finite
cyclic Galois extension of $F$.  The theory of base change associates to
an irreducible smooth $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\_l$-representation $(\pi_F,
V)$ of ${\rm GL}\_n(F)$ an irreducible
$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\_l$-representation $(\pi_E, W)$ of ${\rm GL}\_n(E)$.
The ${\rm GL}\_n(E)$-representation $\pi_E$ extends as a representation of
${\rm GL}\_n(E)\rtimes {\rm Gal}(E/F)$. Assume that the central character
of $\pi_F$ takes values in $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}\_l^\times$, and $l\neq
p$.  When $\pi_E$ is cuspidal, for any ${\rm GL}\_n(E)\rtimes {\rm
Gal}(E/F)$ stable lattice $\mathcal{L}$ in $\pi_E$, Ronchetti supporting
the linkage principle of Treumann and Venkatesh conjectured that the
zeroth Tate cohomology of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to ${\rm Gal}(E/F)$
is the Frobenius twist of mod-$l$ reduction of the representation
$\pi_F$, i.e.,

\begin{equation}
\widehat{H}^0 ({\rm Gal}(E/F), \mathcal{L}) \simeq \overline{\pi} \_F^{(l)}.
\end{equation}

This conjecture is verified by Ronchetti when $\pi_F$ is a depth-zero
cuspidal representation using compact induction model. We will explain a
proof in the case where $n=2$ and $\pi_F$ has arbitrary depth, using
Kirillov model. If time permits, we will discuss the general case by
local Rankinâ€“Selberg convolutions.
