A three dimensional acoustic medium (operator is $\partial\_t^2
- \Delta\_x + q(x)$) is probed by plane waves coming from infinity and
the medium response is measured at infinity. One aims to recover the
acoustic property (the function $q(x)$) from this type of measurement.
Two such ongstanding open problems are the "fixed angle" scattering
problem and the "back-scattering" problem. Both these problems involve
studying the injectivity and the inversion of some non-linear map from
compactly supported smooth functions on $\mathbb{R}^3$ to distributions
on $\mathbb{R}^3$. These maps are defined through non-explicit solutions
of the perturbed wave equation - the existence and uniqueness of these
solutions is well understood.

We will state these two problems, describe what was known and then state
our (with Mikko Salo of University of Jyvaskyla, Finland) injectivity
result for the "fixed angle scattering" problem. If time permits we
will describe some of the ideas used to prove our result for the fixed
angle scattering problem -- Carleman estimates for the perturbed wave
equation play a big role.
