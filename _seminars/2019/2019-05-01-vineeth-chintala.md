In this talk, we will introduce the notion of an embedding of
a quadratic space (in an associative algebra). Familiar
examples of embeddings are given by Complex Numbers, Quaternions,
Octonions, Clifford Algebras, and Suslin Matrices. 

When there are two embeddings of the same quadratic space, then
we can gather information about one embedding using the other.
This is the main theme of the talk. To illustrate this, we will
see the connection between Suslin Matrices and Clifford Algebras.
In one direction, we are able to give a simple description of
Clifford Algebras using matrices. Conversely, we can now explain
some (seemingly) accidental properties of Suslin matrices in a
conceptual way.
