 Since Dvir proved the Finite Kakeya Conjecture in 2008, the Polynomial Method
 has become a new and powerful tool and a new paradigm for approaching extremal
 questions in combinatorics (and other areas too). We shall take a look at the
 main philosophical principle that underlies this method via two recent (2017)
 theorems. One is the upper bound for Cap-sets by Ellenberg–Gijswijt, and the
 other, a function field analogue of a theorem of Sarkozy, due to Ben Green.
