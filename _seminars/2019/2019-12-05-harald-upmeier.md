Automorphic and modular forms in one complex variable (on the upper half-plane)
belong to the most important topics in complex analysis, with close connections to number
theory. In several variables, automorphic forms arise in the study of moduli spaces, with
important theorems in algebraic and analytic geometry concerning quotient spaces by
properly discontinuous groups of holomorphic transformations and their compactification.
In addition, they lead to new and largely unexplored connections to analysis and operator
theory, giving rise to von Neumann algebras which are not of type I. Finally, in the
multivariable setting the Fourier analysis of automorphic forms (theta functions) introduce
new arithmetic structures such as divisibility in Jordan algebras of higher rank.

I plan to divide these lectures into four parts:

- Automorphic Forms in Complex Analysis and Algebraic Geometry
- Construction of multi-variable Automorphic Forms on Lie groups and Siegel domains
- Berezin Quantization of Automorphic Forms and type II von Neumann Algebras
- Scattering Theory on Symmetric Spaces and their non-compact Quotients

Recently, in connection with string theory and topological quantum field theory (in
dimension up to 8) there has emerged the concept of _topological automorphic forms_.
These connections to topology and mathematical physics may be explored at the end.
Another important avenue is the connection to the Langlands program, where
_automorphic representations_ are more generally related to (discrete) series
representations of algebraic groups.
