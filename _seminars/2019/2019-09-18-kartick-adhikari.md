We study the spectrum of a random geometric graph, in a regime
where the graph is dense and highly connected. As opposed to
other random graph models (e.g. the Erdos-Renyi random graph),
even when the graph is dense, not all the eigenvalues are
concentrated around 1. In the case where the vertices are
generated uniformly in a unit d-dimensional box, we show that
for every $0\le k \le d$ there are $\binom{d}{k}$ eigenvalues
at $1-2^{-k}$. The rest of the eigenvalues are indeed close
to 1. The spectrum of the graph Laplacian plays a key role in
both theory and applications. We also show that the corresponding
eigenfunctions are tightly related to the geometric configuration
of the points. Aside from the interesting mathematical phenomenon
we reveal here, the results of this paper can also be used to
analyze the homology of the random Vietoris-Rips complex via
spectral methods.

The talk will be based on a joint work with R. Adler, O. Bobrowski,
and R. Rosenthal.
