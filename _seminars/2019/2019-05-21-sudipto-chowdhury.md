This talk consists of the finite element analysis of a distributed optimal control problem
governed by the von K치rm치n equation that describe the deflection of very thin plates
defined on a polygonal domain of R2 with box constraints on the control variable. In this
talk we discuss a numerical approximation of the problem that employs the Morley
nonconforming finite element method (FEM) to discretize the state and adjoint variables.
The control is discretized using piecewise constants. A priori error estimates are
derived for the state, adjoint and control variables under minimal regularity assumptions
on the exact solution. Error estimates in lower order norms for the state and adjoint
variables are derived. The lower order estimates for the adjoint variable and a
post-processing of control leads to an improved error estimate for the control variable.
Finally we discuss several numerical results to illustrate our theoretical results.
