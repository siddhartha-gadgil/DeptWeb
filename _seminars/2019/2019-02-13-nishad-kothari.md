Valiant (1979) showed that unless P = N P, there is no polynomial-time
algorithm to compute the number of perfect matchings of a given graph –
even if the input graph is bipartite. Earlier, the physicist Kasteleyn
(1963) introduced the notion of a special type of orientation of a graph,
and we refer to graphs that admit such an orientation as Pfaffian graphs.
Kasteleyn showed that the number of perfect matchings is easy to compute
if the input graph is Pfaffian, and he also proved that every planar
graph is Pfaffian. The complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ is the smallest
graph that is not Pfaffian. In general, the problem of deciding whether
a given graph is Pfaffian is not known to be in N P.

Special types of minors, known as conformal minors, play a key role in
the theory of Pfaffian orientations. In particular, a graph is Pfaffian
if and only if each of its conformal minors is Pfaffian. It was shown by
Little (1975) that a bipartite graph $G$ is Pfaffian if and only if $G$
does not contain $K_{3,3}$ as a conformal minor (or, in other words, if
and only if $G$ is $K_{3,3}$-free); this places the problem of deciding
whether a bipartite graph is Pfaffian in co – N P. Several years
later, a structural characterization of $K_{3,3}$-free bipartite graphs
was obtained by Robertson, Seymour and Thomas (1999), and independently
by McCuaig (2004), and this led to a polynomial-time algorithm for
deciding whether a given bipartite graph is Pfaffian.

Norine and Thomas (2008) showed that, unlike the bipartite case, it is 
not possible to characterize all Pfaffian graphs by excluding a finite 
number of graphs as conformal minors. In light of everything that has 
been done so far, it would be interesting to even identify rich
classes of Pfaffian graphs (that are nonplanar and nonbipartite).

Inspired by a theorem of Lovasz (1983), we took on the task of
characterizing graphs that do not contain $K_4$ as a conformal minor –
that is, $K_4$-free graphs. In a joint work with U. S. R. Murty
(2016), we provided a structural characterization of planar $K_4$-free
graphs. The problem of characterizing nonplanar $K_4$-free graphs is much
harder, and we have evidence to believe that it is related to the problem
of recognizing Pfaffian graphs. In particular, we conjecture that every
graph that is $K_4$-free and $K_{3,3}$-free is also Pfaffian. The talk
will be mostly self-contained. I will assume only basic knowledge of
graph theory. For more details, see:
