We discuss some progress in the last decade (and ongoing interest) of
modulation spaces from the PDE point of view. We prove some local
and global well-posedness for Hartree–Fock equations in modulation
spaces. We shall also prove similar results when a harmonic potential
is added to these equations. This is a joint work with Manoussos
Grillakis and Kasso Okoudjou.
