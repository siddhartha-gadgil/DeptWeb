We consider reconstruction of a manifold, or, invariant manifold learning, where
a smooth Riemannian manifold $M$ is determined from intrinsic distances (that is,
geodesic distances) of points in a discrete subset of $M$. In the studied problem
the Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is considered as an abstract metric space with
intrinsic distances, not as an embedded submanifold of an ambient Euclidean space.
Let $\{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_N\}$ be a set of $N$ sample points sampled randomly from an
unknown Riemannian manifold $M$. We assume that we are given the numbers
$D_{jk}=d_M(X_j,X_k)+\eta_{jk}$, where $j,k\in \{1,2,\dots,N\}$. Here, $d_M(X_j,X_k)$
are geodesic distances, $\eta_{jk}$ are independent, identically distributed random
variables such that $\mathbb E e^{|\eta_{jk}|}$ is finite. We show that when $N$ is
large enough, it is possible to construct an approximation of the Riemannian manifold
$(M,g)$ with a large probability. This problem is a generalization of the geometric
Whitney problem with random measurement errors. We consider also the case when the
information on noisy distance $D_{jk}$ of points $X_j$ and $X_k$ is missing with
some probability. In particular, we consider the case when we have no information
on points that are far away.
