In this talk, we shall discuss a combinatorial characterization of the family of secant lines of the
3-dimensional projective space $PG(3,q)$ which meet a hyperbolic quadric in two points (the so called
secant lines) using their intersection properties with points and planes. This is joint work with
Puspendu Pradhan.
