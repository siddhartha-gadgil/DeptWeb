The historical development of the study of operator algebras is intimately
tied with the quest to develop a mathematical formalism for quantum mechanics.
This is what motivated von Neumann to study 'rings of operators' in his seminal
series of papers with Murray. He was dissatisfied with his original Hilbert
space formalism involving the so-called type $I_{\infty}$ algebras and envisaged
the type $II_1$ factors as providing the appropriate description of the logic
of quantum systems. In this talk, we will briefly trace the history of the field
before turning our attention to the question of representing the Heisenberg
commutation relation, $QP - PQ = i\hbar I$, using operators on a Hilbert space.
In the type $II_1$ case, this obstinately leads towards non-selfadjoint operators
and non-selfadjoint operator algebras which have so far been second-class citizens
in comparison to their self-adjoint counterparts (namely, C*-algebras, von Neumann
algebras). We will conduct some mock drills in the world of matrices before moving
our discussion to the algebra of affiliated operators corresponding to a $II_1$
factor (otherwise known as Murray-von Neumann algebras).
