While the enumeration of linear extensions of a given poset is a well-studied
question, its cyclic counterpart (enumerating extensions to total cyclic
orders of a given partial cyclic order) has been subject to very little
investigation. In this talk I will introduce some classes of partial cyclic
orders for which this enumeration problem is tractable. Some cases require
the use of a multidimensional version of the classical boustrophedon
construction (a.k.a. Seidel-Entringer-Arnold triangle). The integers arising
from these enumerative questions also appear as the normalized volumes of
certain polytopes.

This is partly joint work with Arvind Ayyer (Indian Institute of Science)
and Matthieu Josuat-Verges (Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard Monge / CNRS).
