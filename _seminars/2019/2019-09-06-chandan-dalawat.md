We will review the history of solvability of polynomial equations by
radicals, concentrating on the two Memoirs of Evariste Galois.  We will
show how the first Memoir allows us to determine all equations of prime
degree which are solvable by radicals, and the second Memoir similarly
leads to the determination of all primitive equations which are solvable
by radicals.  A finite separable extension $L$ of a field $K$ is called
primitive if there are no intermediate extensions, and solvable if the
Galois group of its Galois closure is a solvable group.  Galois himself
proved in his Second Memoir that if $L$ is both primitive and solvable
over $K$, then the degree $[L:K]$ has to be the power of a prime.  We
parametrise the set of all primitive solvable extensions in terms of
other more computable things attached to $K$.  Thus, when $K$ is a local
field with finite residue field of characteristic $p$, we can explicitly
write down all primitive extensions!  This involves the determination of
all irreducible $\mathbb{F}_p$-representations of the absolute Galois
group of $K$.
