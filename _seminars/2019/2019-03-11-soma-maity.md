Consider Riemannian functionals defined by L^2-norms of Ricci curvature, scalar curvature, Weyl curvature and 
Riemannian curvature.  I will talk about rigidity, stability and local minimizing properties of Einstein metrics 
and their products as critical metrics of these quadratic functionals.  We prove that the product of a spherical 
space form and a compact hyperbolic manifold is unstable for certain  quadratic  functionals  if  the  first eigenvalue
of  the  Laplacian  of  the  hyperbolic  manifold  is sufficiently small.  We also prove the stability of L^{n/2}-norm of Weyl curvature at compact quotients of Sn × Hm.
