 I will begin by reviewing the relationship between Hitchin's Integrable System and 4d N=2 Supersymmetric 
 Quantum Field Theories. I will then discuss two classes of deformations of the Hitchin system which correspond, 
 in the physical context, to relevant and marginal deformations of a conformal theory. The study of relevant 
 deformations turns out to be related to the theory of sheets in a complex Lie algebra and their classification 
 leads to a surprising duality between sheets in a Lie algebra and Slodowy slices in the Langlands dual Lie algebra 
 (work done with J. Distler) . If there is time, I will discuss marginal deformations which are related to studying 
 the Hitchin system as a family over the moduli space of curves including over nodal curves (ongoing project with 
 J. Distler and R. Donagi) .
