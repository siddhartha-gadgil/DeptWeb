In this talk, we discuss the "local smoothing" phenomenon for Fourier integral
operators with amplitude function  belongs to  the "symbol class". We  give an
overview of the regularity results which have been proven to date. We use
harmonic analysis of Hermite functions in the study of Fourier integral operators.
Finally, we give an application of the local smoothing estimate to the wave
equation and maximal operators. This is a joint work with Prof. P. K. Ratnakumar.
