I will give a gentle introduction to the combinatorial Rogers--Ramanujan identities.
While these identities are over a century old, and have many proofs, the first
representation-theoretic proof was given by Lepowsky and Wilson about four decades
ago. Now-a-days, these identities are ubiquitous in several areas of mathematics and
physics. I will mention how these identities arise from affine Lie algebras and
quantum invariants of knots.
