The study of diluted spin glasses may help solve some problems in
computer science and physics. In this talk, I shall introduce the
diluted Shcherbina--Tirozzi (ST) model with a quadratic Hamiltonian,
for which we computed the free energy at all temperatures and external
field strengths. In particular, we showed that the free energy can be
expressed in terms of the weak limits of the quenched spin variances
and identified these weak limits as the unique fixed points of a
recursive distributional operator. The talk is based on a joint work
with Wei-Kuo Chen and Arnab Sen.
