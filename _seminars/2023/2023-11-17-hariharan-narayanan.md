Associated to two given sequences of eigenvalues is a natural polytope, the polytope of augmented hives with the specified boundary
data, which is associated to sums of random Hermitian matrices with these eigenvalues. As a first step towards the asymptotic analysis
of random hives, we show that if the eigenvalues are drawn from the GUE ensemble, then the associated augmented hives exhibit
concentration as the number of eigenvalues tends to infinity.

Our main ingredients include a representation due to Speyer of augmented hives involving a supremum of linear functions applied to a
product of Gelfand--Tsetlin polytopes; known results by Klartag on the KLS conjecture in order to handle the aforementioned supremum;
covariance bounds of Cipolloni--Erd&ouml;s--Schr&ouml;der of eigenvalue gaps of GUE; and the use of the theory of determinantal processes
to analyze the GUE minor process. This is joint work with Scott Sheffield and Terence Tao.
