In 1976 Bernstein, Gelfand, and Gelfand introduced Category $\mathcal{O}$
for a semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. This is roughly the
smallest sub-category of $\mathfrak{g}$-mod containing the Verma modules
and such that the simple modules have projective covers. After work of
Beilinson-Bernstein and Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel it became clear that
the the good homological properties of this category were due to the fact
that it can be identified with a category of perverse sheaves on the flag
variety $G/B$.

In this talk I will show how this story fits into the physics of 3d
mirror symmetry. This leads to conjectural 2-categorifications of
category $\mathcal{O}$ that can be computed explicitly for $\mathfrak{g}
= \mathfrak{sl}_2$.
