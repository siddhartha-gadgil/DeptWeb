Cauchy's determinantal identity (1840s) expands via Schur polynomials the 
determinant of the matrix $f[{\bf u}{\bf v}^T]$, where $f(t) = 1/(1-t)$
is applied entrywise to the rank-one matrix $(u_i v_j)$. This theme has
resurfaced in the 2010s in analysis (following a 1960s computation by
Loewner), in the quest to find polynomials $p(t)$ with a negative
coefficient that entrywise preserve positivity. The key novelty here has
been an application of Schur polynomials, which essentially arise from
the expansion of $\det(p[{\bf u}{\bf v}^T])$.<br><br>

In the first two parts of the talk, I will explain the above journey from
matrix positivity to determinantal identities and Schur polynomials; then
go beyond, to the expansion of $\det(f[{\bf u}{\bf v}^T])$ for all power
series $f$. (Partly based on joint works with Alexander Belton, Dominique
Guillot, Mihai Putinar, and with Terence Tao.) In the third part, joint
with Siddhartha Sahi, I will explain how to extend the above
determinantal identities to
(a) any subgroup $G$ of signed permutations;
(b) any character of $G$, or even complex class function;
(c) any commutative ground ring $R$; and
(d) any power series over $R$.
