Nonlocal conservation laws are gaining interest due to their wide range of applications in modeling
real world phenomena such as crowd dynamics and traffic flow. In this talk, the well-posedness of
the initial value problems for certain class of nonlocal conservation laws, scalar as well as system, will
be discussed and monotone finite volume approximations for such PDEs will be proposed. Strong
compactness of the proposed numerical schemes will be presented and their convergence to the entropy
solution will be proven. Some numerical results illustrating the established theory will also be presented.
