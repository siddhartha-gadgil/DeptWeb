Let `$K$` be an imaginary quadratic field of class number `$1$` such that both `$p$` and `$q$` split in `$K$`. We show that under appropriate hypotheses, the `$p$`-part of the ideal class groups is bounded over finite subextensions of an anticyclotomic `$\mathbb{Z}_q$`-extension of `$K$`. This is joint work with Antonio Lei.
