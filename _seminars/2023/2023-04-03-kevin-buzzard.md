For decades, mathematicians have been using computers to calculate. More recently there has been some
interest in trying to get them to reason. What is the difference? An example of a calculation: compute
the first one million prime numbers. An example of reasoning: prove that there are infinitely many prime
numbers. Tools like ChatGPT can prove things like this, because they have seen many proofs of it on the
internet. But can computers help researchers to come up with new mathematics? Hoping that a computer
will automatically prove the Riemann Hypothesis is still science fiction. But new tools and methods are
becoming available. I will give an overview of the state of the art.
