Non-normal matrices are ubiquitous in various branches of science, such as fluid dynamics, mathematical
physics, partial differential equations, and many more. Non-normality causes notorious sensitivity of
the eigenvalues, and the eigenvalue analysis often turns out to be misleading. These motivate the study
of pseudospectrum, and the spectral properties of random perturbation of  non-normal matrices. In the
first part of the talk, we will introduce these issues and their resolutions through some fun experiments
and simulations. In the latter half, we will move to describe spectral properties of random perturbations
of non-normal Toeplitz matrices, where over the last few years a coherent theory has emerged.
