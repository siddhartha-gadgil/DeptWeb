If we had two extra thumbs, how would we check if "2024" is divisible by eleven? Or by "11"? We will see a simple test for any
divisor $d$, in any coprime base $B$ - i.e. usable by species having any number of fingers (whether shaped like hot-dogs or not).
That is, the test works for everything ($d$), everywhere ($B$), all at once.

We will then move to recurring decimals. Note that 1/3 = 0.3333... and 1/3x3 = 0.1111... have the same number of digits - one -
in their recurring parts. (Is 3 the only prime with this property in base 10?) More generally, we will see how many digits $1/d$
has in its recurring "decimal" expansion, for us or for any species as above.

Finally, for a species with a given number of fingers (= digits!), are there infinitely many primes $p$ for which the recurring part
of $1/p$ has $p-1$ digits? (E.g. for us, 1/7 has the decimal recurring string (142857).) And what does this have to do with Gauss,
Fermat, and one of the Bernoullis? Or with Artin and a decimal number starting with 0.3739558136... ? I will end by mentioning why,
given four species with 6, 10, 15, 30 fingers, the infinitude of primes above is true for at least one of the species. (But, we
don't know which one!)
