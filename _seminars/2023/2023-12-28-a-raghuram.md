The basic ideas of Calculus started with Archimedes, and reached a highly developed form in the 17th Century
with Newton and Leibniz often being credited as its inventors. What was not so well-known until only a few
decades ago is that between the 14th and 17th Century there was an unbroken lineage of profound mathematicians
working in Kerala who had independently discovered many of the great themes of Calculus. This talk is an
introduction to the lives and works of some of the prominent members of the Kerala School of Mathematics.
Most of the talk will be accessible to a general audience. Only towards the end of the talk some elementary
mathematics will be assumed to explain a few of their contributions.
