Let $G$ be a finite simple graph (with no loops and no multiple edges), and let $I_G(x)$ be the
multi-variate independence polynomial of $G$. In 2021, Radchenko and Villegas proved the following
interesting characterization of chordal graphs, namely $G$ is chordal if and only if the power
series $I_G(x)^{-1}$ is Horn hypergeometric. In this talk, I will give a simpler proof of this
fact by computing $I_G(x)^{-1}$ explicitly using multi-coloring chromatic polynomials. This is a
joint work with Dipnit Biswas and Irfan Habib.
