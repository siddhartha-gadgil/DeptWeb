Let `$p$` be an odd prime, `$f$` be a `$p$`-ordinary newform of weight `$k$` and `$h$` be a normalized cuspidal `$p$`-ordinary Hecke eigenform of weight `$\ell < k$`. Let `$p$` be an Eisenstein prime for `$h$` i.e. the residual Galois representation of `$h$` at `$p$` is reducible. In this talk, we show that the `$p$`-adic `$L$`-function and the characteristic ideal of the `$p^{\infty}$`-Selmer group of the Rankin-Selberg convolution of `$f$`, `$h$` generate the same ideal modulo `$p$` in the Iwasawa algebra i.e. the Rankin-Selberg Iwasawa main conjecture for `$f \otimes h$` holds modulo `$p$`. This is a joint work with Somnath Jha and Sudhanshu Shekhar.
