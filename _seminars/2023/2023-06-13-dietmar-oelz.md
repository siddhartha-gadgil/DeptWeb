The origins of disordered actomyosin network contraction such as in the cellular cortex
remain an active topic of research. We derive an agent-based mathematical model for the
evolution of two-dimensional networks. A major advantage of our approach is that it enables
direct calculation of the network stress tensor, which provides a quantitative measure of
contractility. Exploiting this, we use simulations of disordered networks and find that both
protein friction and actin filament bending are sufficient for contraction.

Asymptotic analysis of a special case of this model implies that bending induces a geometric
asymmetry that enables motors to move faster close to filament plus-ends, inhibiting expansion.

We also explore a minimal model for pattern formation through biased turnover of actin filaments.
The resulting discrete-time interacting particle system can be interpreted as voter model with
continuous opinion space. We fully characterise the asymptotic shape of solutions which are
characterised by transient clusters.
