The  (tame) class field theory for a smooth variety `$X$` is the
study of describing the abelianized (tame) {\'e}tale fundamental group of
`$X$`in terms of some groups which are defined using algebraic cycles of `$X$`.
In this talk, we study the tame class field theory for smooth varieties
over local fields. We will begin with defining few notions and recalling
various results from the past to overview the historical background of the
subject. We will then study abelianized tame fundamental group denoted as
`$\pi^{ab,t}_{1}(X)$`, with the help of reciprocity map `$\rho^{t}_{X} :
C^{t}(X) \rightarrow \pi^{ab,t}_{1}(X)$` and will describe the kernel and
topological cokernel of this map. This talk is based on a joint work with
Prof. Amalendu Krishna and Dr. Rahul Gupta.
