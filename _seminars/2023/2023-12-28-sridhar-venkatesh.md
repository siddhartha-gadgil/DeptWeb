For a smooth variety $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$, the de Rham complex of $X$ is
a powerful tool to study the geometry of $X$ because of results such as
the degeneration of the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence (when $X$ is
proper). For singular varieties, it follows from the work of Deligne and
Du Bois that there is a substitute called the Du Bois complex which
satisfies many of the nice properties enjoyed by the de Rham complex in
the smooth case. In this talk, we will discuss some classical
singularities associated with this complex, namely Du Bois and rational
singularities, and some recently introduced refinements, namely k-Du Bois
and k-rational singularities. This is based on joint work with Wanchun
Shen and Anh Duc Vo.
