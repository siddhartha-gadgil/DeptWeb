A "buckyball" or "fullerene" is a trivalent graph embedded in the sphere, all of whose rings have length 5 or 6.
The term originates from the most famous buckyball, "Buckminsterfullerene," a molecule composed of 60 carbon atoms.
In this talk, I will explain why there are exactly 1203397779055806181762759 buckyballs with 10000 carbon atoms.
