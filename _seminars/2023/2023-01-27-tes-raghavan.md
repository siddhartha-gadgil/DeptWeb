While statistical decision theory led me to game theory, certain war duel models, and the close connection
between the Perron--Frobenius theorem and game theory led me to the works of M.G. Krein on special classes
of cones, and spectral properties of positive operators. The influence of Professors V.S. Varadarajan,
K.R Parthasarathy and S.R.S Varadhan in early 60's at ISI is too profound to many of us as young graduate
students in 1962-66 period. The talk will highlight besides the theorems, the teacher-student interactions
of those days.
