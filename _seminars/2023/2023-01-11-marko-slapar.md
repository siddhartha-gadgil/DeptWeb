 The Thom conjecture, proven by Kronheimer and Mrowka in 1994, states that complex curves in $\mathbb{C}{\rm P}^2$ are genus minimizers in their homology class. We will show that an analogous statement does not hold for complex hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}{\rm P}^3$. This is joint work with Ruberman and Strle.
