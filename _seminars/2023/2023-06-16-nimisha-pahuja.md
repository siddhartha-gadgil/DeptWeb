This thesis focuses on the study of correlations in multispecies totally and partially asymmetric exclusion processes
(TASEPs and PASEPs). We study various models, such as multispecies TASEP on a continuous ring, multispecies PASEP on
a ring, multispecies B-TASEP, and multispecies TASEP on a ring with multiple copies of each particle. The primary
goal of this thesis is to understand the two-point correlations of adjacent particles in these processes. The details
of the results are as follows:

We first discuss the multispecies TASEP on a continuous ring and prove a conjecture by Aas and Linusson (AIHPD, 2018)
regarding the two-point correlation of adjacent particles. We use the theory of multiline queues developed by Ferrari
and Martin (Ann. Probab., 2007) to interpret the conjecture in terms of the placements of numbers in triangular arrays.
Additionally, we use projections to calculate correlations in the continuous multispecies TASEP using a distribution
on these placements.

Next, we prove a formula for the correlation of adjacent particles on the first two sites in a multispecies PASEP on
a finite ring. To prove the results, we use the multiline process defined by Martin (Electron. J. Probab., 2020), which
is a generalisation of the Ferrari-Martin multiline process described above.

We then talk about multispecies B-TASEP with open boundaries. Aas, Ayyer, Linusson and Potka (J. Physics A, 2019)
conjectured a formula for the correlation between adjacent particles on the last two sites in a multispecies B-TASEP.
To solve this conjecture, we use a Markov chain that is a 3-species TASEP defined on the Weyl group of type B. This
allows us to make some progress towards the above conjecture.

Finally, we discuss a more general multispecies TASEP with multiple particles for each species. We extend the results
of Ayyer and Linusson (Trans. AMS., 2017) to this case and prove formulas for two-point correlations and relate them
to the TASEP speed process.
