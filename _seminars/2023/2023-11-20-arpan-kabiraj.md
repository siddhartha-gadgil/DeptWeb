In 80's Goldman introduced a Lie bracket structure on the free homotopy classes of oriented closed curves on an oriented surface 
known as the Goldman Lie bracket. In this talk, I will give a brief overview of Goldman Lie algebra and discuss two criteria for a 
homotopy class of a curve to be simple in terms of the Goldman Lie bracket.
