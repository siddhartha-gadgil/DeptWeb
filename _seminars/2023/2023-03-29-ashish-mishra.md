Consider a finite group $G$ and a prime number $p$ dividing the order of $G$.
A $p$-regular element of $G$ is an element whose order is coprime to $p$. An
irreducible character $\chi$ of $G$  is called a quasi $p$-Steinberg character
if $\chi(g)$ is nonzero for every $p$-regular element $g$ in $G$. The quasi
$p$-Steinberg character is a generalization of the well-known $p$-Steinberg
character.  A group, which does not have a non-linear quasi $p$-Steinberg character,
can not be a finite group of Lie type of characteristic $p$. Therefore, it is
natural to ask for the classification of all non-linear quasi $p$-Steinberg
characters of any finite group $G$. In this joint work with Digjoy Paul and Pooja
Singla, we classify quasi $p$-Steinberg characters of all finite complex reflection
groups.
