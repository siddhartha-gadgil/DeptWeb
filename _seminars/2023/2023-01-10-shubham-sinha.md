 The intersection theory of the Grassmannian, known as Schubert calculus, is an important development in geometry,
 representation theory and combinatorics. The Quot scheme is a natural generalization of the Grassmannian. In
 particular, it provides a compactification of the space of morphisms from a smooth projective curve C to the
 Grassmannian. The intersection theory of the Quot scheme can be used to recover Vafa-Intriligator formulas, which
 calculate explicit expressions for the count of maps to the Grassmannian subject to incidence conditions with
 Schubert subvarieties.

The symplectic (or orthogonal) Grassmannian parameterizes isotropic subspaces of a vector space endowed with
symplectic (or symmetric) bilinear form. I will present explicit formulas for certain intersection numbers of the
symplectic and the orthogonal analogue of Quot schemes. Furthermore, I will compare these intersection numbers
with the Gromov–Ruan–Witten invariants of the corresponding Grassmannians.
