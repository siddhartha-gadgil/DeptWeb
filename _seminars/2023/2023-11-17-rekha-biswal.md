In this talk, I will discuss about the structure of ideals in enveloping
algebras of affine Kac&ndash;Moody algebras and explain a proof of the
result which states that if $U(L)$ is the enveloping algebra of the
affine Lie algebra $L$ and "$c$" is the central element of $L$, then any
proper quotient of $U(L)/(c)$ by two sided ideals has finite
Gelfand&ndash;Kirillov dimension. I will also talk about the applications
of the result including the fact that $U(L)/(c-\lambda)$ for non zero
$\lambda$ is simple. This talk is based on joint work with Susan J.
Sierra.
