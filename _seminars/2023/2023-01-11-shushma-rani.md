Let $\mathfrak g$ be a Borcherds--Kac--Moody Lie superalgebra (BKM superalgebra in short)
with the associated graph $G$. Any such $\mathfrak g$ is constructed from a free Lie superalgebra
by introducing three different sets of relations on the generators:
(1) Chevalley relations,
(2) Serre relations, and
(3) Commutation relations coming from the graph $G$.
By Chevalley relations we get a triangular decomposition $\mathfrak g = \mathfrak n_+ \oplus
\mathfrak h \oplus \mathfrak n_{-}$, and each root space $\mathfrak g_{\alpha}$ is either
contained in $\mathfrak n_+$ or $\mathfrak n_{-}$. In particular, each $\mathfrak g_{\alpha}$
involves only the relations (2) and (3). In this talk, we will discuss the root spaces of $\mathfrak g$
which are independent of the Serre relations. We call these roots free roots of $\mathfrak g$. Since
these root spaces involve only commutation relations coming from the graph $G$ we can study them
combinatorially using heaps of pieces and construct two different bases for these root spaces of
$\mathfrak g$.
