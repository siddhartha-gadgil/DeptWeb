Motivated by optimization considerations and the (matrix theory) inequalities of Ky Fan and von Neumann,
we introduce a Fan-Theobald-von Neumann system as a triple $(V,W,\lambda)$, where  $V$ and $W$ are real
inner product spaces and $\lambda:V\rightarrow W$ is a (nonlinear) map satisfying the following condition:
For all  $c,u\in V$,  
$$\max \big \{\langle c,x\rangle: x\in [u]\big \}=\langle \lambda(c),\lambda(u)\rangle,$$
where $[u]:= \{x:\lambda(x)=\lambda(u)\}$.

This simple formulation happens to be equivalent to the Fenchel conjugate formula of the form
$(\phi\circ \lambda)^*=\phi^*\circ \lambda$ and a subdifferential formula in some settings and becomes useful
in addressing linear/distance  optimization problems over "spectral sets" which are of the form
$\lambda^{-1}(Q)$, where $Q$ is a subset of $W$.
Three standard examples of FTvN systems are:  $(R^n,R^n,\lambda)$ with 
$\lambda(x):=x^\downarrow$ (the decreasing rearrangement of the vector $x\in R^n$);
$({\cal H}^n,R^n,\lambda)$, where ${\cal H}^n$ is the space of $n$ by $n$ complex Hermitian matrices with $\lambda$ denoting the eigenvalue map;
and $(M_n,R^n, \lambda)$, where $M_n$ is the space of $n$ by $n$ complex matrices with $\lambda$ denoting the singular value map.
Other examples come from Euclidean Jordan algebras, systems induced by certain hyperbolic polynomials, and normal decomposition systems
(Eaton triples). In the general framework of Fan-Theobald-von Neumann systems, we introduce and elaborate on the concepts of
commutativity, automorphisms, majorization, etc. We will also  talk about "transfer principles" where properties (such as convexity)
of $Q$ are carried over to $\lambda^{-1}(Q)$, leading to a generalization of a celebrated convexity theorem of Chandler Davis.
