In this talk, we first introduce the basic structure of tumors and consequently
present some fundamental modelling aspects of tumor growth based on
ODE / PDE models. We then introduce the biphasic mixture theory based
mathematical model for the hydrodynamics of interstitial fluid motion and
mechanical behavior of the solid phase inside a solid tumor. We introduce
what is called in-vivo and in-vitro tumors considering an isolated
deformable biological medium. The solid phase of the tumor is constituted
by vasculature, tumor cells, and extracellular matrix, which are saturated by
a physiological extracellular fluid. The mass and momentum equations for
both the phases are coupled due to the interaction term. Well-posedness
results will be discussed in brief. The criterion for necrosis will be shown in
terms of the nutrient transport.
