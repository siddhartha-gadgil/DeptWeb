In this talk, we discuss various aspects of weighted kernel functions on planar domains. We focus on two key kernels, namely,
the weighted Bergman kernel and the weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel.

For a planar domain $D \subset \mathbb C$ and an admissible weight function $\mu$ on it, we discuss some aspects of the
corresponding weighted Bergman kernel $K_{D, \mu}$. First, we see a precise relation between $K_{D, \mu}$ and the classical
Bergman kernel $K_D$ near a smooth boundary point of $D$. Second, the weighted kernel $K_{D, \mu}$ gives rise to weighted
metrics in the same way as the classical Bergman kernel does. Motivated by work of Mok, Ng, Chan--Yuan and Chan--Xiao--Yuan
among others, we talk about the nature of holomorphic isometries from the disc $\mathbb D \subset \mathbb C$ with respect to
the weighted Bergman metrics arising from weights of the form $\mu = K_{\mathbb D}^{-d}$ for some integer $d \geq 0$. Specific
examples that we discuss in detail include those in which the isometry takes values in $\mathbb D^n$ and
$\mathbb D \times \mathbb B^n$ where each factor admits a weighted Bergman metric as above for possibly different non-negative
integers $d$. Finally, we also present the case of isometries between polydisks in possibly different dimensions, in which each
factor has a different weighted Bergman metric as above.

In the next part of the talk, we discuss properties of weighted Szeg\H{o} and Garabedian kernels on planar domains. Motivated by
the unweighted case as explained in Bell's work, the starting point is a weighted Kerzman--Stein formula that yields boundary
smoothness of the weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel. This provides information on the dependence of the weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel as a
function of the weight. When the weights are close to the constant function $1$ (which corresponds to the unweighted case), we
show that some properties of the unweighted Szeg\H{o} kernel propagate to the weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel as well. Finally, we show
that the reduced Bergman kernel and higher order reduced Bergman kernels can be written as a rational combination of three
unweighted Szeg\H{o} kernels and their conjugates, thereby extending Bell's list of kernel functions that are made up of simpler
building blocks that involve the Szeg\H{o} kernel.
