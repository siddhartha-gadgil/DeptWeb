We study the spectral gap phenomena for weighted $L^p$-Hardy inequalities on $C^{1,\gamma}$-domain with a
compact boundary, where $\gamma\in (0,1]$. We show that the weighted Hardy constant is attained by some
appropriate minimizer if and only if the spectral gap (the difference between the weighted Hardy constant
and the weighted Hardy constant at infinity ) is strictly positive. Moreover, we obtain tight decay estimates
for the corresponding minimizers. In this talk, we will try to understand how the ideas in criticality theory
help us to extend the spectral gap phenomena from $C^2$-domains to $C^{1,\gamma}$-domains.
This talk is based on the joint work with Yehuda Pinchover, Baptiste Devyver.
