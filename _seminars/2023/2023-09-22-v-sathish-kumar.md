Let $\mathfrak g$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebra with
Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak h$. We prove that unique factorization
holds for tensor products of parabolic Verma modules. We prove more
generally a unique factorization result for products of characters of
parabolic Verma modules when restricted to certain subalgebras of
$\mathfrak h$. These include fixed point subalgebras of $\mathfrak h$
under subgroups of diagram automorphisms of $\mathfrak g$. This is
joint work with K.N.Raghavan, R.Venkatesh and S.Viswanath.
