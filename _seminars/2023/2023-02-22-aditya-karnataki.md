Andreatta, Iovita, and Pilloni have proven the existence of an adic eigencurve, which includes characteristic `$p$` points at the boundary. In joint work with Ruochuan Liu, using the theory of Crystalline periods, we show that the Galois representations associated to these points satisfy an appropriate trianguline property.
