The Virasoro algebra, which can be realized as a central extension of (complex) polynomial vector fields
on the unit circle, plays a key role in the representation theory of affine Lie algebras, as it acts on
almost every highest weight module for the affine Lie algebra. This remarkable phenomenon eventually led
to constructing the affine-Virasoro algebra, which is a semi-direct product of the affine Lie algebra and
the Virasoro algebra with a common extension. The representation theory of the affine-Virasoro algebra has
been studied extensively and is an extremely well-developed classical object.

In this talk, we shall consider a natural higher-dimensional analogue of the affine-Virasoro algebra,
popularly known as the full toroidal Lie algebra in the literature and henceforth classify the
irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over this Lie algebra. As a by-product, we also obtain the
classification of all possible irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over the higher-dimensional Virasoro
algebra, thereby proving Eswara Rao's conjecture (conjectured in 2004). These directly generalize the
well-known result of O. Mathieu for the classical Virasoro algebra and also the recent work of
Billig--Futorny for the higher rank Witt algebra.
