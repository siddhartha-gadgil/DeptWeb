Branching rules are a systematic way of understanding the multiplicity of
irreducible representations in restrictions of representations of Lie
groups. In the case of $GL_n$ and orthogonal groups, the branching rules
are multiplicity free, but the same is not the case for symplectic
groups. The explicit combinatorial description of the multiplicities was
given by Lepowsky in his PhD thesis. In 2009, Wallach and Oded showed
that this multiplicity corresponds to the dimension of the multiplicity
space, which was a representation of $SL_2$ $(=Sp(2))$. In this talk, we
give an alternate proof of the same without invoking any partition
function machinery. The only assumption for this talk would be the Weyl
character formula.
