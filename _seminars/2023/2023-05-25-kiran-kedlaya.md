We classify similarity classes of tetrahedra whose dihedral angles are
all rational multiples of $\pi$ (when measured in radians), answering a
question of Conway-Jones from 1976. In the process, we also classify
collections of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose pairwise angles are rational.
The proof uses a mixture of theoretical arguments, exact computations in
computer algebra, and floating-point numerical computations. (Joint with
Alexander Kolpakov, Bjorn Poonen, and Michael Rubinstein.)
