This thesis concerns the construction of harmonic maps from certain non-compact surfaces into hyperbolic 3-space
$\mathbb{H}^3$  with prescribed asymptotic behavior and has two parts.

The focus of the first part is when the domain is the complex plane. In this case, given a finite cyclic configuration
of points  $P \subset \partial\mathbb{H}^3=\mathbb{CP}^1$, we construct a harmonic map from $\mathbb{C}$ to
$\mathbb{H}^3$ that is asymptotic to a twisted ideal polygon with ideal vertices contained in $P$. Moreover, we prove
that given any ideal twisted polygon in $\mathbb{H}^3$ with _rotational symmetry_, there exists a harmonic map
from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{H}^3$ asymptotic to that polygon. This generalizes the work of Han, Tam, Treibergs, and
Wan which concerned harmonic maps from $\mathbb{C}$ to the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$.

In the second part, we consider the case of equivariant harmonic maps. For a closed Riemann surface $X$, and an
irreducible representation $\rho$ of its fundamental group into $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$, a seminal theorem of Donaldson
asserts the existence of a $\rho$-equivariant harmonic map from the universal cover $\tilde{X}$ into $\mathbb{H}^3$.
In this thesis, we consider domain surfaces that are non-compact, namely \textit{marked and bordered surfaces} (introduced
in the work of Fock-Goncharov). Such a marked and bordered surface is denoted by a pair $(S, M)$ where $M$ is a set of
marked points that are either punctures or marked points on boundary components. Our main result in this part is: given
an element $X$ in the enhanced Teichmuller space $\mathcal{T}^{\pm}(S, M)$, and a non-degenerate type-preserving framed
representation  $(\rho,\beta):(\pi_1(X), F_{\infty})\rightarrow (PSL_2(\mathbb{C}),\mathbb{CP}^1)$, where $F_\infty$ is
the set of lifts of the marked points in the ideal boundary, there exists a  $\rho$-equivariant harmonic map from
$\mathbb{H}^2$ to  $\mathbb{H}^3$ asymptotic to $\beta$.

In both cases, we utilize the harmonic map heat flow applied to a suitably constructed initial map. The main analytical
work is to show that the distance between the initial map and the final harmonic map is uniformly bounded, proving the
desired asymptoticity.
