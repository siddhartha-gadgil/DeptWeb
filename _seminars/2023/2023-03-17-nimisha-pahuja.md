This thesis focuses on the study of correlations in multispecies totally and 
partially asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEPs and PASEPs). We study various 
models, such as multispecies TASEP on a continuous ring, multispecies PASEP on 
a ring, multispecies B-TASEP, and multispecies TASEP on a ring with multiple 
copies of each particle. The primary goal of this thesis is to understand the 
two-point correlations of adjacent particles in these processes. 
The details of the results are as follows:

We first discuss the multispecies TASEP on a continuous ring and prove a conjecture 
by Aas and Linusson (AIHPD, 2018) regarding the two-point correlation of adjacent 
particles. We use the theory of multiline queues developed by Ferrari and Martin 
(Ann. Probab., 2007) to interpret the conjecture in terms of the placements of numbers 
in triangular arrays. Additionally, we use projections to calculate correlations
in the continuous multispecies TASEP using a distribution on these placements.

Next, we prove a formula for the correlation of adjacent particles on the first two 
sites in a multispecies PASEP on a finite ring. To prove the results, we use the 
multiline process defined by Martin (Electron. J. Probab., 2020), which is a
generalisation of the Ferrari-Martin multiline process described above.

We then talk about the multispecies B-TASEP with open boundaries. Aas, Ayyer, Linusson 
and Potka (J. Physics A, 2019) conjectured a formula for the correlation between adjacent particles 
on the last two sites in a multispecies B-TASEP. To solve this conjecture, we use a 
Markov chain that is a 3-species TASEP defined on the Weyl group of type B. 
This allows us to make some progress towards the above conjecture.

Finally, we discuss a more general multispecies TASEP with multiple particles for each 
species. We extend the results of Ayyer and Linusson (Trans. AMS., 2017) to this case 
and prove formulas for two-point correlations and relate them to the TASEP speed process.
