n-Laplace systems with antisymmetric potential are known to govern
geometric equations such as n-harmonic maps between manifolds and
generalized prescribed H-surface equations. Due to the nonlinearity of
the leading order n-Laplace and the criticality of the equation they
are very difficult to treat.

I will discuss some progress we obtained, combining stability methods
by Iwaniec and nonlinear potential theory for vectorial equations by
Kuusi-Mingione. Joint work with Dorian Martino.
