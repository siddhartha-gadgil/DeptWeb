Let `$N$` be a prime number `$>3$`. Mazur has defined, from the theory of modular forms, a unit `$u$` in `$\mathbb{Z}/N$`. This unit turned out to be, up to a `$6$`-th root of unity,`$\prod_{k=1}^{(N-1)/2}k^k$`. 
In this talk we will describe how the unit is connected to various objects in number theory. For instance:
–The unit `$u$` can be understood as a derivative of the zeta function at `$-1$`, (despite living in a finite field).
– Lecouturier has shown that this unit is the discriminant of the Hasse polynomial: `$\sum_{i=0}^{(N-1)/2}a_i X^i$` modulo `$N$`, where `$a_i$` is the square of the `$i$`-th binomial coefficient in degree `$N$`.
– Calegari and Emerton have related `$u$` to the class group of the quadratic field `$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-N})$`.
For every prime number `$p$` dividing `$N-1$`, It is important to determine when `$u$` is a `$p$`-th power in `$(\mathbb{Z}/N)^*$`. 
If time allows, I will describe the connections to modular forms and Galois representations, and the general theory that Lecouturier has developed from this unit. For instance,when `$u$` is not a `$p$`-th power, a certain Hecke algebra acting on modular forms is of rank `$1$` over the ring of `$p$`-adic integers `$\mathbb{Z}_p$` (the original motivation of Mazur). The unit plays an important role in the developments around the conjecture of Harris and Venkatesh.
