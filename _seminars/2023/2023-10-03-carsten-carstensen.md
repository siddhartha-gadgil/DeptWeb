Recent advances in the nonconforming FEM approximation of elliptic
PDE eigenvalue problems include the guaranteed lower eigenvalue
bounds (GLB) and its adaptive finite element computation. The first part of
the talk explains the derivation of GLB for the simplest second-order
(and fourth-order) eigenvalue problems with relevant applications,
e.g., for the localization of the critical load in the buckling
analysis of the Kirchhoff plates. The second part mentions an optimal
adaptive mesh-refining algorithm for the effective eigenvalue computation
for the Laplace (and bi-Laplace) operator with optimal convergence
rates in terms of the number of degrees of freedom relative to the concept
of nonlinear approximation classes. Numerical experiments in the
third part of the presentation shows benchmarks in which the
naive adaptive mesh-refining and the post processed GLB do not lead to 
efficient GLB. The fourth part outlines a new  extra-stabilised 
scheme based on extended Crouzeix-Raviart (resp. Morley) finite elements 
that directly computes approximations as GLB and that allows
optimal convergence rates at the same time.

The presentation is on joint work with Dr. Sophie Puttkammer.
