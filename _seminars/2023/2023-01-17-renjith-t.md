This talk will comprehensively examine the homogenization of partial differential equations (PDEs) and optimal
control problems with oscillating coefficients in oscillating domains. We will focus on two specific problems.
The first is the homogenization of a second-order elliptic PDE with strong contrasting diffusivity and $L^1$
data in a circular oscillating domain. As the source term we are considering is in $L^1$, we will examine the
renormalized solutions. The second problem we will investigate is an optimal control problem governed by a
second-order semi-linear PDE in an $n$-dimensional domain with a highly oscillating boundary, where the
oscillations occur in m directions, with $1<m<n$. We will explore the asymptotic behavior of this problem by
homogenizing the corresponding optimality systems.
