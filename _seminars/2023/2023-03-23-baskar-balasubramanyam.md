Let `$F$` be a totally real field. Let `$\pi$` be a cuspidal cohomological automorphic representation for `$\mathrm{GL}_2/F$`. Let `$L(s, \mathrm{Ad}^0, \pi)$` denote the adjoint `$L$`-function associated to `$\pi$`. The special values of this `$L$`-function and its relation to congruence primes have been studied by Hida, Ghate and Dimitrov. Let `$p$` be an integer prime.  In this talk, I will discuss the construction of a `$p$`-adic  adjoint `$L$`-function in neighbourhoods of very decent points of the Hilbert eigenvariety.  As a consequence, we relate the ramification locus of this eigenvariety to the zero set of the `$p$`-adic `$L$`-functions. This was first established by Kim when `$F=\mathbb{Q}$`. We follow Bellaiche's description of Kim's method, generalizing it to arbitrary totally real number fields. This is joint work with John Bergdall and Matteo Longo.
