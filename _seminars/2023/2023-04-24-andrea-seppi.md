The Asymptotic Plateau Problem is the problem of existence of submanifolds of vanishing mean curvature with prescribed boundary “at infinity”. 
It has been studied in the hyperbolic space, in the Anti-de Sitter space, and in several other contexts. In this talk, I will present the 
solution of the APP for complete spacelike maximal p-dimensional submanifolds in the pseudo-hyperbolic space of signature (p,q). In the second part 
of the talk, I will discuss applications of this result in Teichmüller theory and for the study of Anosov representations. This is joint work 
with Graham Smith and Jérémy Toulisse.
