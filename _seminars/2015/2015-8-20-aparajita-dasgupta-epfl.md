In this talk we prove a version of the Gohberg lemma on compact Lie groups giving an estimate from below for the distance from a given operator to the set of compact operators on compact Lie groups. As a consequence, we prove several results on bounds for the essential spectrum and a criterion for an operator to be compact. The conditions are given in terms of the matrix-valued symbols of operators. (This is a joint work with Professor Michael Ruzhansky.)
