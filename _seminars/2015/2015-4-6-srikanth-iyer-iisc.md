In wireless networks, where each node transmits independently of
other nodes in the network (the ALOHA protocol), the expected delay
experienced by a packet until it is successfully received at any other
node is known to be infinite for signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(SINR) model with node locations distributed according to a Poisson point
process. Consequently, the information velocity, defined as the limit of
the ratio of the distance to the destination and the time taken for a
packet to successfully reach the destination over multiple hops, is zero,
as the distance tends to infinity. A nearest neighbor distance based power
control policy is proposed to show that the expected delay required for a
packet to be successfully received at the nearest
neighbor can be made finite. Moreover, the information velocity is also
shown to be non-zero with the proposed power control policy. The condition
under which these results hold does not depend on the intensity of the
underlying Poisson point process.
