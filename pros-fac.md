## Why join us

The Indian Institute of Science is a premier Institute of higher learning and
research in the country. It has more than 40 departments/centres/units and
nearly 450 faculty members pursuing research in many areas of science and
engineering.

The Department of Mathematics has established itself as an excellent centre for
research in both pure and applied mathematics. It has a small but active
research faculty, and seeks mathematicians who will add to the research profile
of the department. In addition to the regular (i.e., post-M.Sc./M.Tech.) Ph.D.
programme, the Department has an Integrated Ph.D. programme that admits
students with plans for research in mathematics right after their Bachelors
degree.

The Department of Mathematics welcomes applications in all fields of
mathematics from researchers who are exceptionally motivated, and have an
established record of independent, high-quality research, for Assistant
Professorships in the Department of Mathematics.

Prospective candidates must have a Ph.D. (in relevant area) and must have
completed three years of post-doctoral research at the time of appointment
(relaxable in exceptional cases) and, preferably, be below 35 years in age.
The salary will be in the pay grade Rs. 30,000+8,000 per month (basic salary
for this designation plus grade pay) plus allowances --- with raises each year.
The total monthly pay includes:

* Dearness Allowance (DA), which currently (as of August, 2017) stands at 136%
  of one's basic plus grade pay (and which is usally revised every 6 months);
* Transport Allowance, which currently stands at Rs. 3200 plus 136% (this
  supplement is at the prevailing rate of the DA, and rises along with it).

Thus, the total emoluments, at present, for this pay grade stand at Rs. 97,230
per month. Additionally, a newly-appointed Assistant Professor can either opt
for on-campus housing, or claim a House Rent Allowance of Rs. 11,400
(i.e., 30% of Rs. 38,000).

At the end of three years' service, an Assistant Professor's pay is raised to
the pay grade Rs. 37,400+9000 per month. At the current rates of exchange, 1 US
dollar = Rs. 63.95 approximately; also 1 PPP-US dollar = Rs. 18.19
(approximately) which is the _effective_ value of the US dollar against the rupee
adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (**source:** World Development Indicators:
2016, World Bank).


**Central government pay-scales and salaries are currently in the process of revision,**
owing to which the salaries for the pay grades are expected to rise very soon.


Interested candidates may apply by sending a curriculum vitae, list of
publications along with reprints of important publications, a description of
proposed research, names and addresses (with e-mail and fax number) of at least
three referees, and any other relevant details to:

The Chairman

## Some useful tips:

In case you have decided to apply to the Department of Mathematics at the
Indian Institute of Science, here are a few points that might be useful to bear
in mind.

1. The Department of Mathematics aims to recruit, over time, mathematicians
   with increasingly strong academic records. Thus, if you are interested in
   applying and there are colleagues in the department who work in your area
   of interest, then you might find it helpful to talk/write to a colleague
   who was hired relatively recently to get a sense of the prevailing
   standards in hiring.

2. Please take a look at [IISc Faculty Hiring](http://iisc.ac.in/opportunities/#ffs-tabbed-14) to get a sense of the steps in the
   recruitment procedure at the Indian Institute of Science. While
   [faculty recruitment](https://sites.google.com/site/newfacultyiisc/recruitment) is not a webpage
   authorized by the Indian Institute of Science, the information on it is
   fairly representative of applications to the Department of Mathematics.

3. One of consequences of a rolling process of recruitment is that, as
   alluded to in (2), a decision on your application could take as little as
   3 months or as long as 8–9 months. In case your mailing address changes in
   the interim, please be sure to communicate any changes in your address.

4. Since the eventual settlement of all job applications (numbering in the
   hundreds) across all departments is done centrally, it might not be
   possible for the Registrar to notify applicants individually that a
   position has been filled. However, feel free to contact the Chairman,
   Department of Mathematics, a few months into the process to inquire
   informally about your application.
