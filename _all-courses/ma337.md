The goal of this course is to use computers to address various
questions in Topology and Geometry, with an emphasis on arriving at
rigourous proofs. The course will consist primarily of assignments
and projects. The computing tools used will include wrting own programs,
existing Automated Theorem Proving Programs and packages like Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab.
