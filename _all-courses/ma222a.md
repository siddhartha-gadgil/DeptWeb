necessary.

The aim is to treat certain topics which are just a tad too advanced to be included in a first course in measure and integration theory, but are not too specialized and are useful to
analysts in general.
Main Topics:
1. Fourier Transform: Riemann- Lebesgue lemma, L^2 theory.
2. Convergence in Measure.
3. Riesz Representation Theorem.
4. Functions of Bounded Variations; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for absolutely continuous functions.
5. Hausdorff Measures, Isodiametric Inequality.
6. Area, Co-area Formulas.
In addition to these, some extra topics will be covered, depending on the instructor and time.
