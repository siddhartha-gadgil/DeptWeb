The course is about the ergodic theory of actions by (subgroups of) semisimple Lie
groups which arise as groups of isometries of non-compact symmetric spaces. Some of the
main topics include Howe-Moore’s theorem on vanishing of matrix coefficients at infinity for
unitary actions on Hilbert spaces, Moore’s ergodicity theorem, ergodic aspects of the geodesic
flow, the horocycle flow and classification of ergodic invariant measures of the horocycle flow.
Dani-Margulis’ proof of a stronger version of Oppenheim’s conjecture will be discussed at the
end of the course as an application of topics covered.
Topics from the theory of non-compact semisimple Lie groups including Cartan involution,
restricted root spaces, Weyl chambers, Iwasawa decomposition, Cartan decomposition and
Bruhat decomposition will be discussed in some detail. Basic topics from ergodic theory like
ergodicity, strong mixing and the pointwise ergodic theorem will also be recalled.
