This course is an introduction to classical Iwasawa theory, up to the
proof of the Iwasawa main conjecture following Mazur and Wiles. We will
begin with a review of results from algebraic number theory, class field
theory etc. This will be followed by a study of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ extensions of
number fields. We will then concentrate on the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$
extensions of number fields. This will be followed by formulation of the
Iwasawa main conjecture. For this part we need knowledge of $p$-adic
$L$-functions. If time permits we will see Wiles's proof of the Iwasawa
main conjecture.
