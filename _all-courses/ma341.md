This course explores matrix positivity and operations that preserve it. These involve fundamental questions that have been extensively studied over the past century, and are still being studied in the mathematics literature, including with additional motivation from modern applications to high-dimensional covariance estimation. The course will bring together techniques from different areas: analysis, linear algebra, combinatorics, and symmetric functions.

__List of topics__ (time permitting):

__1.__ _The cone of positive semidefinite matrices. Totally positive/non-negative matrices._
Examples of PSD and TP/TN matrices (Gram, Hankel, Toeplitz, Vandermonde, $\\mathbb{P}\_G$). Matrix identities (Cauchy-Binet, Andreief). Generalized Rayleigh quotients and spectral radius. Schur complements.

__2.__ _Positivity preservers._
Schur product theorem. Polya-Szego observation. Schoenberg's theorem. Positive definite functions to correlation matrices. Rudin's (stronger) theorem. Herz, Christensen-Ressel. 

__3.__ _Fixed-dimension problem._
Introduction and modern motivations. H.L. Vasudeva's theorem and simplifications. Roger Horn's theorem and simplifications.

__4.__ _Proof of Schoenberg's theorem._
Characterization of (Hankel total) positivity preservers in the dimension-free setting.

__5.__ _Analytic/polynomial preservers – I._
Which coefficients can be negative? Bounded and unbounded domains: Horn-type necessary conditions.

__6.__ _Schur polynomials._
Two definitions and properties. Specialization over fields and for real powers. First-order approximation.

__7.__ _Analytic/polynomial preservers – II._
Sign patterns: The Horn-type necessary conditions are best possible. Sharp quantitative bound. Extension principle I: dimension increase.

__8.__ _Entrywise maps preserving total positivity._
