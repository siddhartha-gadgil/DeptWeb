  It is desirable to have taken MA 262 Introduction to Stochastic Processes and MA 361 Probability Theory or equivalent. Students who have not taken this course can also register for this course. They must then learn the introductory probability material covered in the first three chapters of Introduction to Stochastic Finance Vol II by Shreve before discrete time option pricing is covered in the course.
