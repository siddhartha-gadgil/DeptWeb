<p>Department of Mathematics was established in 1956 and over the
  years has evolved into a Department with a healthy balance between
  pure and applied mathematics. The Department has a vibrant research
  atmosphere backed up by excellent infrastructural facilities.
  We have a modern computer laboratory and a good Departmental library.
  <a href="faculty.html">Members of our faculty</a> have won many
  honours in recognition of their academic achievements. </p>
<p>The Department admits students under two programmes - the <a href="degprog-phd.html">Ph.D.
  programme</a> and the <a href="degprog-intphd.html">integrated
  Ph.D. programme</a>. Further information can be found by following
  the links on the home page. In the current economic scenario,
  employment opportunities for Ph.D.'s in mathematics are excellent
  - both in academics and in industry. </p>
<p>The Department has pioneered interdisciplinary programmes like
  the <a href="https://math.iisc.ac.in/~imi" target="_blank">IISc
  Mathematics Initiative</a>. It takes active part in the Indo-French <a href="http://disc.iisc.ernet.in/ficus/ficus.html" target="_blank">Cyber
  University project</a> with Toulouse University Network. The Department
  is also deeply involved in the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana
  and the <a href="http://vyasa.math.iisc.ernet.in/" target="_blank">Mathematical
  Olympiad</a> programme.</p>
