### Overview

Many real-world problems are naturally modeled by graphs, with vertices representing entities and (weighted) edges representing relationships. This course introduces **graphical designs**, **graph sparsifiers**, and **conformal rigidity**, all centered around the geometry and spectral properties of graphs. These problems sit at the intersection of **spectral graph theory**, **combinatorics**, **convex geometry**, **harmonic analysis**, and **optimization**.

Topics include:
- Graphical designs and their connection to spherical designs
- Graph sparsifiers and spectrahedra
- Conformal rigidity in graphs and optimization of Laplacian eigenvalues
- Applications to random walks, coding theory, and more

Finite Cayley graphs and tools like **Gale duality** and **semidefinite programming** will be highlighted.
