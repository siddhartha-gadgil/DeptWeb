title : "Informal Workshop on Lean Prover and Math-AI"
date : 2025-04-21
---

There will be many events related to Formalisation, Lean Theorem Prover and AI for Mathematics at IISc between Monday, April 21, 2025 and Wednesday, April 23, 2025. These are organised/supported by  [Kotak IISc AI-ML Centre](https://kiac.iisc.ac.in/).

There will be three kinds of events. Except for the symposium in the Faculty Hall, all events will be at LH-3, Department of Mathematics, IISc.

* **Talks:** A symposium with three talks plus three separate talks  
* **Lean project discussion:** Students who are working on Lean projects will present for discussion on improvements, fixes, future work etc. Those taking the course [Proofs and Programs](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/proofs-and-programs-2025/) will present. Others are welcome to present.  
* **Lean Labs**: Informal, weakly structured meetings to learn and/or work together on various aspects of Lean, Mathlib and Lean tooling (more details below).

### Monday, April 21

* 10:00–12:00 : Lean Projects discussion  
* 2:00–5:15 :  Symposium on  [Formalisation, Mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence](https://kiac.iisc.ac.in/upcoming-events/) at the Faculty Hall, IISc:   
  * 2:00–3:00 PM: Koundinya Vajjha, *Formal Verification for Mathematics, Software, and Hardwar*e  
  * 3:00–4:00 PM: Bhavik Mehta, *Mathematics, AI, and Lean*  
  * 4:00–4:15 PM: Coffee break  
  * 4:15–5:15 PM: Patrick Massot, *Why Formalise Mathematics*?

### Tuesday, April 22

* 9:00–11:00 : Lean Labs  
* 11:00–12:00 : Anne Baanen, [*Certifying Algebraic Number Theory Computation*](../seminars/2025/2025-04-22-anne-baanen.html)  
* 2:30–3:30 : Filippo Nuccio and Ricardo Brasca, [*Formalising Class Groups and Fermat's Last Theorem for Regular Primes*](..//seminars/2025/2025-04-22-ricardo-brasca-filippo-nuccio.html)  
* 4:00–5:00 : Patrick Massot, [*Lean for Teaching*](../seminars/2025/2025-04-22-patrick-massot.html)

### Wednesday, April 23

* 9:00–12:30 : Lean Labs  
* 2:00–4:00 : Lean Projects Discussion  
* 4:00–5:00 : Ashvi Narayanan, [*Opportunities in Math-AI and Lean-Math-AI*](../seminars/2025/2025-04-23-ashvni-narayanan.html)

### Lean Labs:

These will be informal sessions consisting of:

* Demos/Tutorials/Deep dives  
* Getting together to work on something specific

Where the topics can be:

* Specific techniques, tools etc in Lean (or AI for Mathematics)  
* Specific topics for Lean/Mathlib

The plan is to mix presentations to everyone and break-outs into smaller groups. All are welcome to suggest topics that they want to learn or work on. Some of the topics suggested/planned so far are:

* Proofs of primality for large numbers  
* Knot theory   
* Number theory in Mathlib  
* Widgets  
* Autoformalization  
* Meta-programming
