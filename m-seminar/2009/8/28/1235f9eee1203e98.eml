Abstract:
       The polarization conjecture for R^d is that

max_{x \in R^d, ||x||=1} |<x, u_1>    <x, u_i>| \geq (1/\sqrt{d})^d

for any set of d unit vectors u_1,    , u_d in R^d with equality
occurring iff u1,    , ud are orthonormal. We describe results directed
towards proving this conjecture and also the connections between this
conjecture and other problems in the geometry of R^d. The talk is based on
work done in collaboration with YJ Leung and W Li.
