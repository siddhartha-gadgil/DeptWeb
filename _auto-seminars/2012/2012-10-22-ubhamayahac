We study risk-sensitive control of continuous time Markov
chains taking values in discrete state space. We study both finite
and infinite horizon problems. In the finite horizon problem we
characterise the value function via HJB equation and obtain an
optimal Markov control. We do the same for infinite horizon
discounted cost case. In the infinite horizon average cost case
we establish the existence of an optimal stationary control under
certain Lyapunov condition. We also develop a policy
iteration algorithm for finding an optimal control.
