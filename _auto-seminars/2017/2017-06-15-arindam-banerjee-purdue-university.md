title: "Homological Invariants and Combinatorics of Finite Simple Graphs"
time: "3pm"

In this talk the interplay between the combinatorial structures of finite simple graphs and various homological invariants like regularity, depth etc. of related algebraic objects shall be discussed. Some open problems, recent developments and ongoing projects shall be discussed. In particular some new techniques developed in my thesis to study Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of algebraic objects related to graphs shall be discussed in some details.
