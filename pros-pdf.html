title: Postdoctoral Positions
---
<p>
The department hosts three types of postdoctoral fellows. These are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><h5>Postdoctoral Instructor positions</h5>
        <p style="margin-top:0.4cm;">
        The institute has Postdoctoral <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/3.-Advertisement-UGI.pdf" target="_blank"> Instructor</a> positions for the Undergraduate BTech and BS programs. These involve a modest teaching load and give an opportunity to be part of the department and institute. The positions are extendable up to five years.</p>
        <p>
        The instructor position involves three Teaching Assistant duties per year (two in one semester and one in the other). Each TA duty involves one tutorial session per week, grading of assignments for about 15 students, and helping with conduct and grading of examinations.</p>
        <p>Positions are available both for those with two years of post PhD experience and for those with recent PhD degrees, with salaries adjusted for experience (see details in the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/3.-Advertisement-UGI.pdf" target="_blank"> advertisement</a>). It is expected that all the salaries will be increased by 20% by the time the candidates join.</p>

    <li><h5>Externally-funded postdoctoral fellows</h5>


        <p style="margin-top:0.4cm;">
            Most of the postdocs hosted by the department are funded by external fellowships. Some of these fellowships
            are:

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.nbhm.dae.gov.in/postdoct.html">NBHM Postdoctoral Fellowship</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://www.ugc.ac.in/ugc_notices.aspx?id=NDUzOQ==">Dr. S. Radhakrishnan UGC Post-Doctoral
                Fellowship 
                </a></li>

            <li><a href="http://serb.gov.in/page/awards_fellowship#National%20Post%20Doctoral%20Fellowship">National Postdoctoral Fellowship</a> </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p> <b>Disclaimers.</b> For the latest information on these fellowships, please check their websites. Some of these may no longer be available. At the same time, there may be other funding opportunities that are not listed above. </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom:0.8cm;">If you wish to apply for any of these, and then join the department, you must first identify a prospective <a
                href="https://math.iisc.ac.in/faculty.html">faculty mentor</a> in your area of research, and seek
            their consent to host you at the department. The faculty member will inform you of their decision after
            consultation with the Postdoctoral Fellows Committee, which may contact you for more information to assess
            your suitability for the position.
        </p>

    </li>


    <li> <h5>Institute-funded postdoctoral fellows</h5>
        <p style="margin-top:0.4cm;">

            The institute offers a select number of postdoctoral fellowships. If
            you wish to be hosted at the mathematics department as an institute PDF, please carefully read the <a
                href="https://iisc.ac.in/careers/post-doctoral-fellowship/"> institute advertisement</a> for these positions, and <b>follow the
                procedure outlined in the advertisement</b>. 

        <p style="margin-bottom:0.8cm;">
            Please note that the Raman PDF is a highly competitive and prestigious fellowship, and the department
            recommends very few applications for further screening at the institute level. The candidate must show a
            strong record of independent and high-quality research.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li> <h5>Postdocs funded by individual faculty grants</h5>

        <p style="margin-top:0.4cm;margin-bottom:0.8cm;">
            Some members of our <a href="https://math.iisc.ac.in/faculty.html">faculty</a> may also have grants that
            can support a post-doctoral position. You may write to faculty members (in your area of research) to enquire
            about the possibility of such funding.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><b>All postdocs will be expected to teach/perform TA duties depending on the department's requirements.</b></p>
